title: "Spectral Citadel: The Kowloon Walled City as a Memory Space in Hong Kong Cinema (1970–2024)"
excerpt: "Abstract: This paper analyzes how Hong Kong cinema from the 1970s to 2024 reimagines the Kowloon Walled City as a site of memory and identity. Inspired by coursework in _Cultural Memory_, it developed into an independent study using textual analysis. After one major revision, it was ultimately rejected by Continuum and later refined as the author’s PhD writing sample."

**Introduction: Research Background and Literature Review**

Since the last brick of Kowloon Walled City was dismantled in 1994, its ghostly afterimage has persisted in Hong Kong cinema with a cultural longevity vastly disproportionate to its mere 30,000 square meters of physical space.
In the realm of postcolonial memory, the Walled City has come to symbolize a vanished Hong Kong, even though colonial Hong Kong was never exactly an organically grown, self-governing entity ( Lee, 2016). From the 1970s, its unregulated structures rose up to 14 stories, forming a densely packed space often deprived of natural light (Crawford, 2019). Over 70 percent of residents were from Guangdong’s Chaozhou region and spoke a dialect distinct from Cantonese, fostering a self-contained community culture within the Walled City (Lee, 2016). Because of a prolonged legal vacuum, the area became a hub for illicit activities like prostitution, gambling, and drug trafficking, severely compromising public safety and making life harsh for residents (Sinn, 1987). To address the issues and prepare for the 1997 handover, the colonial government demolished the Walled City in 1994 and replaced it with Kowloon Walled City Park (Crawford, 2019).
Due to its unique politics, dense architecture, and chaotic conditions, the spatial rendering of the Walled City has become a form of cultural production in Hong Kong cinema. It functions not only as a physical location but also as a cultural symbol and a kind of representational space (Zheng, 2019). The Walled City has taken on what Grace (2007, p. 468) calls a ‘spectral monumentality,’ preserving the memory of demolished architecture within the urban body and cinematic text. In this sense, the meaning of the Walled City has become fully detached from its historical reality, serving instead as a vessel for Hong Kong’s collective memory and identity (Li, 2024). As Lefebvre (1991) argues, the meaning of space is never confined to its material form; rather, it is constantly produced and reinterpreted through social interaction. The cinematic reappearance of the Walled City makes lived experience transformed into a symbolic space in collective memory, layered with emotional and political meanings. As Mennel (2008, p. 88) points out, Hong Kong filmmakers often engage with urban space, including the Walled City, in a highly self-reflexive manner, using multiple literary and visual narratives to explore and rearticulate questions of urban meaning and identity anxiety.  
As a subject of urban planning and governance, the Walled City was shaped by shifting spatial regimes, and its cinematic portrayal reflected changing political and cultural agendas. From Giddens’ (1990) perspective, the Walled City belonged to what might be called the ‘backstage’ of the city, excluded or intentionally obscured by dominant urban practices. Liu (2004) similarly observes that the image space projected in many Hong Kong films reflects a cognitive framework that shapes how audiences perceive the city. Situated outside the mainstream, the Walled City functioned as a counter-site that offered critical insight into the inner workings of the urban system. Studying the cinematic reconstructions of the Walled City, then, offers a valuable lens through which to reflect on Hong Kong’s collective memory and identity formation.
Before moving into the main analysis, it is necessary to review the existing scholarship to clarify the current academic landscape and identify research gaps. First, studies on the politics of memory in the humanities in Hong Kong often place collective memory in relation to questions of sovereignty. As early as the eve of the handover, Abbas (1997) argued that Hong Kong’s ‘culture of disappearance’ fostered an identity anxiety rooted in spatial absence, highlighting the intrinsic link between memory and sovereignty negotiations. Chow (1998) also underscored the complex, reciprocal relationship between ethnography and visual media. 
More specifically, in the field of film studies, much of the research on memory politics has revolved around the entanglement of nostalgia and identity, though with differing emphases. For instance, Ng (2000) examined the politics of nostalgia in 1990s Hong Kong cinema; Vivian Lee (2009) introduced the notion of ‘post-nostalgic imagination’ to describe post-1997 films, interpreting nostalgia as a form of ironic engagement with globalized depoliticized consumption. Chu (2004) traced how local identity was negotiated through film under the dual pressures of global capitalism and the ‘China factor,’ arguing that the search for a distinct Hong Kong identity was tightly linked to the city’s economic success. Scholars such as Lin (2008) and Chu (2013) further explored identity representations in nostalgic Hong Kong films.
Turning to spatial concerns, academic inquiry into the Walled City started relatively late but has expanded rapidly in recent years. Fraser and Li (2017) and Kong (2024) examined how the Walled City memory has been translated across transnational cultural products. Lee (2016) discussed how the photographic collection City of Darkness Revisited commemorates and historicizes the Walled City, offering a postcolonial reimagining of identity. From the perspective of media geography, Yuda (2020) analyzed how cinematic depictions in both Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong films construct the Walled City’s spatial, temporal, and local dimensions.
A review of the existing literature reveals three key areas of scholarly consensus relevant to this discussion. First, the memory work in Hong Kong cinema has consistently operated in parallel with questions of political sovereignty and the logic of capital. Second, nostalgia functions not only as a commercial genre strategy but also as a cultural practice of identity construction. Third, specific spaces such as the Walled City serve a dual function in film, reflecting historical absence and shaping imagined community. However, the political context and market ecology of Hong Kong’s image production have undergone significant shifts since the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the implementation of the National Security Law in 2020 (Chan, 2024; Hawkins & Davidson, 2024; White, 2021). While some studies have examined how films like Raise the Umbrellas (2016) and Ten Years (2015) articulate forms of ‘democratic collective memory’ (Coe, 2022; Carrico, 2017), systematic longitudinal research remains limited on how the spatial imaginary of the Walled City has been continuously rewritten across historical periods, especially in the post-Umbrella era.
Therefore, this article identifies the 1994 demolition of the Walled City and the 2014 Umbrella Movement as two critical turning points. It examines ten Hong Kong feature films produced between 1973 and 2024 that center the Walled City as a core symbolic image, with the aim of tracing how its cinematic narrative has evolved over time. The analysis examines how the Walled City accumulates symbolic meanings across political contexts and how Hong Kong cinema constructs identity by rewriting it on screen. This reflects Hall’s (2004) view that cultural identity is fluid, shaped by changing social and historical forces, including cinematic reproduction.


**Before the Demolition (1973–1994): Spatial Constructions of Lion Rock Spirit and Legal-Order Discourse**

In the two decades leading up to the demolition of Kowloon Walled City, its cinematic representation in Hong Kong films gradually established a culturally specific model: on the one hand, it was framed as a grey zone marked by the absence of legal order; on the other, it embodied the solidarity, resilience, and moral code of the grassroots population.
This duality was first articulated in The House of 72 Tenants (Chor, 1973), which laid the groundwork for later cinematic representations of the Walled City by establishing a foundational spatial and ethical framework. The film’s densely packed ‘main building’ clearly draws inspiration from Walled City architecture (Yuda, 2020). It depicts working-class residents supporting one another amid poverty and landlord exploitation. Although the term ‘Lion Rock Spirit’ is never used, its themes of perseverance, grassroots cooperation, and moral solidarity would later define that ethos (Lai, 2017). Through its spatial focus, The House of 72 Tenants (Chor, 1973) offers a visual model of collective resistance: tenants may quarrel, but unite when it matters. As Huang (2022) notes, this spatial narrative has been repeatedly adapted in later Walled City films.
Approaching the 1980s, The Rascal Billionaire (Bai Fen Shuang Xiong, Siu, 1978) and Brothers from the Walled City (Cheng Zhai Chu Lai Zhe, Lam, 1982) extended the theme of grassroots solidarity while introducing narratives centered on marginal violence and grey-zone order. In Brothers from the Walled City (Lam, 1982), brothers Cheng Jia-jun and Cheng Jia-kang grow up inside the Walled City, traumatized by witnessing their father’s murder in a revenge killing. One of the brothers later falls in love with the daughter of police officer Cheung Hing-cheung, triggering a conflict between personal emotion and institutional authority. The film ends tragically: one brother is manipulated into committing suicide, the other ends up in prison. Although Cheung is eventually arrested for abuse of power, the film doesn’t critique the legal system itself; rather, it blames corruption on a few rogue officers. Similarly, The Rascal Billionaire (Siu, 1978) tells the story of the Chu brothers, who amass wealth through prostitution, gambling, and drug trafficking, only to surrender to the police after being betrayed by an insider. Despite their criminal background, the film portrays their surrender as a voluntary return to order, with no attempt to resist, bribe, or escape from the legal system.
Both films characteristically portray the Walled City as a lawless grey zone, where violence coexists with loyalty, and an informal order is sustained through kinship and brotherhood. External police authority is positioned as the ultimate arbiter, rendering the relationship between law enforcement and grassroots communities a form of negotiated order. Drawing on Chu’s (2013) analysis of Hong Kong’s cultural transformations, these films may appear on the surface to extend the Lion Rock Spirit’s ideals of perseverance and solidarity, but in essence they reaffirm a latent identification with colonial legal authority. This identification functions as an unconscious cinematic reproduction of ideology, where individual behaviors like voluntary surrender or deference to authority help naturalize the legitimacy of the legal system. As Lai (2017) argues, the Lion Rock Spirit exerts subtle control through its materialized cultural form: it is not just a form of entertainment for the working poor, but also a mechanism for stabilizing public sentiment. This mirrors Althusser’s (2014) notion of ideological state apparatuses, in which the governed come to accept and even defend the legitimacy of their own subordination.
It is worth noting that Brothers from the Walled City (Lam, 1982) and The Rascal Billionaire (Siu, 1978) both focus on the internal tension within Hong Kong between legality and illegality, order and disorder, without directly referencing Mainland China or its people. This internal dynamic, however, is disrupted in Long Arm of the Law (Sheng Gang Qi Bing, Mak, 1984), which introduces a new spatial logic centered on border infiltration and identity defense. The film depicts a criminal gang composed of three retired soldiers from Guangzhou as an external threat invading Hong Kong. The Chinese subtitle ‘Sheng Gang Qi Bing’ literally translates as ‘Red Guards in Guangzhou and Hong Kong,’ directly referencing veterans who had participated in the Red Guard movement. Within the film, the term ‘Big Circle Boys’ is used to label the gang, a reference to maps previously published in China that marked major cities with populations over one million, including Guangzhou, using three concentric circles (Lok, 1999).
The film opens with semi-documentary-style footage showing how these men, unemployed due to China’s economic restructuring, are recruited into crime syndicates. Scenes of them clutching old-style train tickets, sneaking across the border, and reacting in awe and confusion upon encountering neon-lit Kowloon dramatize their cultural and institutional dislocation from modern Hong Kong. In the film’s climax, the Big Circle Boys retreat into the Walled City to seek help from an unlicensed doctor, who secretly alerts the police and triggers a large-scale gunfight. It concludes with a rooftop shootout in which the intruders are gunned down amid clouds of smoke, reinforcing the Walled City’s symbolic function as a final defensive outpost.
In the early 1980s, amid China’s economic reforms and Sino-British negotiations, Hong Kong cinema increasingly portrayed Chinese state power as a metaphor for cross-border intrusion and latent threat (Chu, 2013, p. 25). This context shaped a narrative shift in Long Arm of the Law (Mak, 1984), where Mainland characters became threatening Others, and the Walled City transformed from a grassroots haven into a symbolic fortress resisting external order. The film uses spatial invasion to dramatize political breakdown, turning a survival space into a battlefield. This resistance narrative externalizes colonial anxieties in the formula ‘Mainland = threat.’ Police and Walled City residents unite against the ‘Big Circle Boys,’ reinforcing colonial legal authority and redefining who qualifies as a Hongkonger.
Crime Story (Zhong An Zu, Wong, 1993) was the last major Hong Kong film to shoot on location inside the Walled City before its demolition. The production team received permission to plant explosives and film demolition scenes inside the vacated buildings just before the clearance works (Crime Story (1993 film), n.d.). Inspired by the 1990 Teddy Wang kidnapping, the film follows Inspector Eddie Chan as he uncovers a conspiracy involving a fellow officer, Hung Ting-bong, and the kidnappers. In the film, the Walled City is framed as the final battleground between criminal gangs and a coalition of ICAC agents and righteous police officers. The climax culminates in a hand-to-hand fight between Chan and Hung, ending in an explosive building collapse. The demolition sequence, running nearly seven minutes (1:31:05–1:39:00, Wong, 1993), shows bricks and fireballs sealing off narrow corridors and obliterating the Walled City. Unlike Long Arm of the Law (Mak, 1984), which highlighted the threat of ‘outside intrusion’ Crime Story (Wong, 1993) shifts its focus to internal corruption. Hung reveals the hostage’s location before dying in flames, symbolizing a final purge of internal rot within the colonial legal system. Released at a time when the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) was widely respected for its anti-corruption efforts, and with the demolition of the Walled City already underway. In this sense, Crime Story (Wong, 1993) doesn’t just document the physical end of the Walled City—it uses spatial annihilation to affirm the legitimacy of law and order, and a kind of psychological cleansing for a pre-handover Hong Kong.
Jou (2014) challenges the idea that the Walled City was merely a slum, portraying it instead as a fully functioning and vibrant community where residents maintained hope and resilience despite harsh conditions. While individual memories of the Walled City vary, two elements consistently surface as shared spatial memory: the vertically stacked residential layout and the self-governed nature of community life. At the same time, Hong Kong’s sociopolitical structure during this period was largely shaped by an uneasy alliance between triad members and the police, a dynamic that provided fertile ground for the boom of the crime film genre (Shen, 2017). Within this heterogeneous space, local dwellers and external actors together formed the survivalist landscape frequently depicted on screen. As Fraser and Li (2017, p. 225) observe, the Walled City was often reimagined during this era either as ‘a slum to escape from’ or ‘a zone of lawlessness.’ 
Yet closer analysis reveals that such narratives of disorder never truly undermined the legitimacy of legal authority. On the contrary, they frequently reinforced the cultural core of colonial rule by staging the intervention of police forces as both necessary and redemptive. The Walled City was not merely a narrative backdrop on the urban periphery, it also stood at the symbolic intersection of grassroots resilience, legal ethics, and identity politics. Its continued cinematic presence reflects Hong Kong society’s deep psychological tension between aspirations for autonomy and dependence on established institutions.


**After the Demolition (1995–2013): Nostalgic Constructions of Lost Space and the Crisis of Identity**

According to Stewart (1993, p. 23), nostalgic narratives often summon a past that ‘has never existed except as narrative,’ in an effort to fill the absence created when ‘the present is denied’. As discussed earlier, pre-demolition films tended to depict the Walled City through documentary realism, focusing on violence and internal order. Since the early 2000s, symbolic narratives have reimagined the Walled City as a lost space of emotional intensity. Some films used horror imagery or symbolic stand-ins like ‘Pigsty Walled City’ not to recover historical accuracy, but to transform this ‘city of absence’ into a screen for projecting collective mourning. 
More specifically, Kung Fu Hustle (Gong Fu, Chow, 2004) exemplifies what Boym (2001) terms restorative nostalgia. Historically, the Walled City became a 'no-man's land' as the absence of regulation allowed vice industries such as gambling, prostitution, and drug trafficking to flourish. Early films such as The Rascal Billionaire (Siu, 1978) and Brothers from the Walled City (Lam, 1982) centered their narratives around this lawless reality. In contrast, Stephen Chow’s Kung Fu Hustle (Chow, 2004) entirely erases this grey backdrop. Several scenes directly reference the 1973 film The House of 72 Tenants (Chor, 1973), including rooftop clotheslines, rent-collection episodes, and a noisy central courtyard, allowing audiences to re-experience the solidarity and resilience of the Lion Rock Spirit within a familiar comedic frame. The landlady tolerates tenants who can’t pay rent, while the tenants, in turn, defend the community with their martial arts. As one resident defiantly tells Sing, ‘I’m not afraid. You can kill me, but there will be thousands more like me’ (00:14:50–00:14:56, Chor, 1973). Warm tones and nostalgic filters further draw viewers into emotional identification, culminating in a poignant finale in which the protagonist, Sing, releases the ‘flower of evil’ from the ruins of the Walled City.
The 1997 handover ended British colonial rule in Hong Kong and destabilized Hongkongers’ previously stable self-identification. In a global order structured around modern nation states, Hong Kong, possessing a ‘city identity’ without a corresponding ‘national identity,’ has struggled to locate itself (Wang et al., 2010). Nostalgia, as scholars have noted, is often triggered by fear, dissatisfaction, anxiety, or uncertainty, and may be interpreted as a response to pessimism about social transformation (Richards et al., 2020; Turner, 1987). Kung Fu Hustle (Chow, 2004) not only extends the narrative model seen in Long Arm of the Law (Mak, 1984), in which the Walled City functions as a defensive bastion against external threats, but also, through its romanticized rendering of the past, offers a form of emotional buffering in the face of present-day political tension.
By contrast, Johnnie To’s Election (Long Cheng Sui Yue, 2005) aligns more closely with what Boym (2001) describes as reflective nostalgia. Unlike Kung Fu Hustle (Chow, 2004), which reconstructs the past with unequivocal affirmation, Election (To, 2005) offers a hesitant, critical, and introspective engagement with history. Although Election (To, 2005) does not depict Kowloon Walled City directly, its Chinese title, Long Cheng Sui Yue (‘Years of the Walled City’), and focus on gang elections evoke its early associations. The film marks a brutal turning point when Big D is killed by Lok, exposing the hollowness of triad honor codes under market logic. The line ‘Times have changed. It’s all business now’ directly reflects what Dai (2017) observed: that traditional values and ideals have steadily receded under the influence of money, and the heroic era has been replaced by an ethos of materialism (To, 2005, 01:03:07). Furthermore, the sequel Election 2 (To, 2006) shows Lok’s son killing his father, critiquing the Walled City’s extra-legal autonomy and reveal its fragility and moral decay.
However, restorative and reflective nostalgia are not strictly oppositional or mutually exclusive categories (Boym, 2001). In Kung Fu Hustle (Chow, 2004), the landlord and landlady, once martial arts masters, withdrew from conflict after losing their son to gang violence, indirectly causing the deaths of three heroes. This mirrors the Walled City's role as a refuge for the marginalized and subtly critiques the consequences of avoiding responsibility. Besides, Election (To, 2005) evokes nostalgia for triad honor codes and self-governance. Director Johnnie To recalled living briefly in the Walled City as a child, describing it as a mixed community of public housing residents and triad members, yet marked by warmth and a strong sense of brotherhood (Wikipedia contributors, n.d.). This depiction of grassroots democracy stands in contrast to the political reality of Hong Kong at the time, reflecting a deeper anxiety and longing for the ideal of ‘Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong.’ 
Building on the theme of forgotten spaces in The H.K. Triad ( O Ji San He Hui Dang An, Huo, 1999) and Re-cycle (Gui Yu, Pang Brothers, 2006), we can observe another trajectory of reflective nostalgia. Unlike Kung Fu Hustle (Chow, 2004) or Election (To, 2005), which focus on the internal ethical collapse within the Walled City, these films shift their attention to how external forces erode local order.
In The H.K. Triad (Huo, 1999), the elderly Ah Ho explains triad traditions to police trainees, whose puzzled faces reflect the fading relevance of old beliefs under a new institutional order. A later flashback traces the brotherhood between Ah Ho, a Walled City triad leader, and Ah Lok, a Chinese inspector, showing how their underground empire thrived under colonial protection until the ICAC brought it down. When the police launch their first large-scale raid on the Walled City, Ah Ho, outraged, shouts: ‘These damn cops have guts—they dare to storm the Walled City!’ To which Ah Lok responds with a wry, resigned smile: ‘I told you, times change’ (Huo, 1999, 01:32:02). The film suggests that the collapse of the Walled City's mythic autonomy was not due to a sudden failure of internal ethics, but rather the result of its forced absorption into a formal legal system. The final shot slowly pans out: the now-paralyzed Ah Ho is fed tenderly by his wife, while a portrait of Guan Gong and a couplet reading ‘Loyalty shines like the sun and moon; righteousness fills the universe’ appear in the background (01:38:31). Despite their lifelong loyalty and brotherhood, the two men are ultimately crushed by the imposition of order. By focusing on the loss of fraternal ideals, the film frames reflective nostalgia as a critique of changing local identity; as external systems replace local customs, the Walled City becomes a hollow sovereignty surrendered through political compromise.
The Pang Brothers’ Re-cycle (2006) takes a different approach: through a supernatural framework, it investigates how abandonment and forgetting erode local order. The film follows Ting-yin, a novelist who inadvertently enters a shadowy otherworld filled with a decaying amusement park, suspended dentist signs, and endlessly falling bodies. This ‘demonized’ ruin of the Walled City has been stripped of its historical context and transformed into a dumping ground for all that society has rejected. An elderly man, seated beneath a dilapidated Ferris wheel, explains to Ting-yin: ‘This place exists because you created it. And it’s not just you—others created it too. This space… you are the creators. This is a space of abandonment. Things that are discarded end up here, but they can disappear at any moment. It’s all just a cycle. The reason we’re here is simple—we are the forgotten’ (00:46:50). The ‘you’ in this monologue refers not only to the individual but also implicitly to broader structures of power and society. In the wake of the sovereignty transfer and the penetration of global capital, the Walled City is refigured as a site of excess—housing the memories and subjects no longer accommodated in the new political-economic order. It becomes a spectral repository of what has been deliberately left behind.
At the emotional core of Re-cycle (Pang Brothers, 2006) is the ghost child Ding-Yu, revealed as Ting-yin’s aborted fetus and a symbol of a deliberately abandoned past. In a confrontational moment, Ding-Yu asks, ‘Do you remember the place where you abandoned the baby? That’s where I grew up. It was terrifying. Now you finally understand how scared I was, don’t you?’ (01:35:28). Later, she refuses Ting-yin’s plea to return to the real world: ‘You want me to go with you? I could have gone with you. I could have lived with you. But you were the one who abandoned me’ (01:37:36). Ding-Yu’s sorrowful grievance and rejection of reconciliation expose the anger and anguish of the forgotten subject and serve as a stark reminder for viewers to confront historical trauma. If The H.K. Triad (Huo, 1999) portrays how brotherhood and loyalty fall silent before colonial law, Re-cycle (Pang Brothers, 2006) dramatizes how historical memory itself becomes voiceless within globalized narrative structures. As Abbas (1997) noted, the city’s urban space has been increasingly subjected to processes of blurring and banalization under the dual forces of sovereignty transfer and globalization. 
Taken together, we can identify three main characteristics in the Walled City nostalgia that emerged during this period. First, the space becomes fully symbolic: after its demolition, Kowloon Walled City no longer functions as a physical site but is ‘dematerialized’ into an emotional vessel for projecting identity anxiety and future uncertainty. Second, nostalgia takes two intertwined affective tendencies: one uses a tender, pastoral tone to soothe post-handover trauma, while the other employs realist or supernatural allegories to reveal the fragility of local ethics under external and global pressures. Third, the narrative focus shifts from internal moral decay to external intervention, questioning who holds the authority to define Walled City memory and using figures of the ‘forgotten’ or ‘excess memory’ to reflect those excluded by sovereignty transfer and economic restructuring.


**Post-Umbrella Movement (2014–Present): Politicized Nostalgia and the Cultural Logic of ‘Safe Narratives’**

As Abbas (1997) observes, Hong Kong’s urban narratives often seek coordinates of identity within a ‘culture of disappearance.’ Following this trajectory, post–Umbrella Movement representations of Kowloon Walled City have shifted from mourning its disappearance to using it as a symbolic device for renegotiating power dynamics among Hong Kong, China, and colonial Britain. 
Chasing the Dragon (Zhui Long, Wong & Kwan, 2017) can be seen as a key turning point in this development. According to Ashcroft et al. (2007, pp. 11–14), anti-colonial discourse frequently operates through institutional resistance and symbolic subversion of colonialism, emphasizing the necessity of rejecting colonial power and reclaiming local agency. Chasing the Dragon (Wong & Kwan, 2017) situates the Walled City of the 1960s and 1970s as the central narrative space. In the film, British police, especially Hunt, are depicted as greedy, brutal, and indifferent, symbolizing ‘the colonial regime’s exploitation and cultural repression of local communities’ (Abbas, 1997, p. 66). The climactic gunfight in the lawless zone is not merely a spectacle but functions as a ritual of national vengeance. Hunt declares within the Walled City, ‘Without the British, Hong Kong would still be just a fishing village,’. When Ng Sek-ho prepares to use a bulldozer to hurl a car with Hunt off a ledge, the scene becomes a symbolic retaliation for nearly a century of colonial humiliation: ‘You bloody gweilos, you plundered and looted Hong Kong. Was it ever yours? It’s ours!’ (01:43:40, Wong & Kwan, 2017). The film positions colonial oppression as the condition to be resisted, thereby recasting this gangster epic as a story of Chinese resistance against foreign oppressors. This anti-colonial reinterpretation of the gangster genre sets The Descendant of the Dragon apart from its predecessors, aligning with what Chu (2022, pp. 3, 47) describes as the ‘tactic’ of ‘main melody films,’ allowing the film to navigate between Hong Kong and Mainland China’s cultural and political spheres.
Viewed through adaptation and narrative strategy, Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In (Jiu Long Cheng Zhai Zhi Wei Cheng, Cheang, 2024) further exemplifies the logic of ‘safe narratives’ in the Hong Kong–Mainland co-production era. The film adapts Andy Seto’s 2011 and 2018 City of Darkness comics but significantly alters their political meaning and narrative drive. In the original comics, the antagonist ‘Big Boss’ launches an attack on the Walled City to retrieve his daughter, who has fled into it after falling in love with the male protagonist, Chan Lok-Kwan. Additionally, the storyline includes a senior police commissioner who manipulates the gang to help eliminate the Walled City and clear the way for government-led demolition. This narrative structure links colonial authority with internal order, serving as a metaphorical critique of the Walled City’s political configuration. In the film version, however, these elements are entirely removed. The motivation behind the Big Boss’s invasion is reduced to economic gain—he aims to monopolize property within the Walled City before demolition to secure inflated compensation. The colonial regime and its governance structures are erased, as are the gendered and romantic plotlines. Instead, the narrative is compressed into a binary conflict between ‘internal gangs’ and ‘external criminal forces,’ resulting in a straightforward martial-arts action story. This narrative choice avoids any critique of historical power structures and sidesteps engagement with current political realities. Instead, it reasserts a depoliticized Lion Rock Spirit through the moral slogan ‘win together, lose together,’ reducing it to an ahistorical and ideologically neutral notion of solidarity.
Throughout the film, viewers are repeatedly reminded that the Walled City is about to be demolished. The death of Long Zuanfeng (Tornado) just before the city’s dismantling frames him as a martyr of the ‘old order.’ This narrative move acknowledges the irreversible end of a historical era while offering audiences the emotional satisfaction of ‘collective resistance’ within the safety of a nostalgic framework. In contrast, the politicized imaginaries of the Walled City seen in 2000s-era films are completely absent here, including Re-cycle (Pang Brothers, 2006), which depicts the city as a haunted ruin filled with suppressed trauma, and Election (To, 2005), which critiques Hong Kong’s political system through an allegory of gangland elections.
Yet positioning the long-demolished Kowloon Walled City as the narrative core over two decades later serves as a political metaphor in itself. In the twenty-first century, the compounded effects of economic downturns, the CEPA co-production framework, and the implementation of the National Security Law have forced filmmakers and producers to navigate a delicate balance between market success and political compliance (Datt, 2021; Heng, 2024). As a result, the Walled City is repackaged as a high-saturation spectacle, foregrounding gang tropes while muting systemic critique. On one hand, such films express to local audiences that ‘we still remember Kowloon Walled City’; on the other, they craft non-confrontational narratives that cater to the Mainland market and remain silent on politically sensitive themes. This reflects a form of ‘compromised nostalgia’: distanced in time, removed to an unverifiable past, and stitched from postcolonial affect and depoliticized narrative. The result is a co-production friendly nostalgic model: emotionally resonant but politically cautious.
The emotional foundation of this negotiated nostalgia, the Lion Rock Spirit, has diverged from its 1970s origins in The House of 72 Tenants (Chor, 1973) and become a contested symbol among competing social forces. After the 2008 Queen’s Pier movement, the Anti-National Education campaign, and the 2014 Umbrella Movement, the younger generation began reframing personal effort as a demand for collective rights (Wong & Yip, 2017, p. 11; Gao, 2024). The traditional values associated with the Lion Rock Spirit—perseverance, solidarity, and mutual aid—are increasingly seen as inadequate for addressing the demands and expectations of a new era and a new generation of Hong Kong citizens. Instead, universal values such as democracy have emerged as the defining essence of a ‘New Lion Rock Spirit,’ underscoring the centrality of justice and fairness in contemporary collective memory (Gao, 2024).
Once a lived-in space located at the foot of Lion Rock, Kowloon Walled City has become a potent cinematic medium through which the transition of Lion Rock Spirit is reflected. The Lion Rock Spirit has become part of Hong Kong’s collective memory, and slogans like ‘solidarity in tight spaces, resilience in adversity’ immediately evoke a sense of the 1970s (Law, 2017). Studies have shown that nostalgia is often accompanied by the illusion that the past was better (Batcho, 1995; Davis, 1979; Duyvendak, 2011; Sedikidis et al., 2008). In Chasing the Dragon (Wong & Kwan, 2017), director Wong Jing invested tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars and spent two months constructing a full-scale replica of the Walled City set. From shop signs to a single newspaper, each prop was carefully selected and weathered for authenticity (Yau, 2020). As Fraser and Li (2017) note, citing film historian So, although Hong Kong has been deeply embedded in global political and economic systems since the 1950s, certain elements have remained resistant to assimilation—Kowloon Walled City being one such ‘indigestible essence,’ symbolizing the city’s inner resilience. In the films, this resilience is translated into a romantic yearning for ‘Old Hong Kong.’ At the same time, the character Shin-yi remarks, ‘The Walled City will be torn down in a few years, but I believe some things will never change’ (01:58:55, Cheang, 2024), invoking a nostalgic rhetoric that affirms the enduring spirit of Lion Rock.
Thus, in the context of democratic movements, the Lion Rock Spirit has been re-mythologized as a renewed nostalgic symbol. It not only embedded in the everyday life of Hong Kong citizens but also manifested in films such as Chasing the Dragon (Wong & Kwan, 2017) and Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In (Cheang, 2024). This helps explain why, after years of dormancy, the Kowloon Walled City genre was able to attract massive investment and achieve commercial success with Walled In. By framing the Walled City as a safe narrative space, the film offers emotional comfort to Hong Kong audiences while ensuring effective appeal and marketability across both local and Mainland markets.


**Conclusion**

The Kowloon Walled City, a landmark in Hong Kong’s urban history, has evolved from a physical site into a space of nostalgia and ultimately a symbolic cultural construct. This article takes cinematic representations of the Walled City from 1973 to 2024 as its object of study, systematically tracing how this symbolic space has been continuously reimagined and reconstructed across different political, social, and cultural contexts. In doing so, it addresses a gap in current scholarship: the lack of a longitudinal, systematic analysis of the Walled City's cinematic imaginary. Specifically, the article argues that between 1973 and 1994, prior to the Walled City’s demolition, films established its initial symbolic meanings by highlighting the interplay between the Lion Rock Spirit and the colonial rule of law. From 1995 to 2013, following its demolition, the Walled City was nostalgically reconstructed in cinema as a vessel for emotional projection and identity anxiety. Since the Umbrella Movement of 2014, it has increasingly served as a spatial metaphor for political unease and cultural reconfiguration. These shifting cinematic narratives underscore the dialectical relationship between space and collective memory, demonstrating how the symbolic significance of the Kowloon Walled City continues to be rewritten and deepened over time.
As Ricœur (2000) observes, memory is not merely a recounting of the past, but a crucial process through which individuals and communities reconstruct their identities, ethics, and orientations toward action. Therefore, reflecting on the past is not merely an indulgence in nostalgia, but a powerful act of resistance against historical forgetting. In the face of the uncertain political horizon of 2047, cinematic nostalgia for Kowloon Walled City is not a retreat from reality but a strategic use of narrative memory to reclaim shared emotions and restore belonging amid uncertainty.
