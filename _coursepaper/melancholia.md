title: "Between Thunderstorms and Tenderness: Everyday Masculinity in _Herstory_ (2024)"
excerpt: "In _Herstory_ (2024), Shao Yihui turns everyday life into a quiet battleground for gender redefinition. This essay reads the film as both a feminist critique and a reflection on the fragility of modern Chinese masculinity. Through humor, tenderness, and contradiction, Herstory reveals that liberation from patriarchy is not only a women’s project—but also a man’s awakening."
