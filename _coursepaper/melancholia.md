title: "Echoes of a Lost Time: Nostalgia and Melancholia in _The Deserted Village_ and _Eton College_"
excerpt: "Abstract: This essay examines The Deserted Village and Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College through the lens of nostalgic melancholia, exploring how both poems dramatize the temporal tension between memory and loss. It argues that Goldsmith’s restorative nostalgia aspires to rebuild a vanished moral order, whereas Gray’s reflective nostalgia accepts irretrievability and turns remembrance into introspection. Together they illuminate the eighteenth century’s poetic negotiation between time, emotion, and historical consciousness."

While Village has often been read as a work of social criticism, with scholars focusing on its political commentary and rhetorical power, the emotional and affective presence of lost time has received comparatively less attention (Lutz, 1998). Similarly, scholarship on Eton has largely concentrated on its structure and rhetoric. Grant (2017) offers useful insights into the poem’s temporal and historical dimensions, but there is still room to explore its emotional landscape through the lens of nostalgic melancholia. This paper aims to contribute to that conversation by comparing The Deserted Village and Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College as two contemporaneous examples of nostalgic poetry, in order to better understand how such poems construct the experience of time (hereafter, The Deserted Village is cited as Village and Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College as Eton).

Goldsmith’s Village presents one of the eighteenth century’s most vivid renditions of a lost rural paradise—Auburn—whose moral ecology is shattered by the forces of enclosure, luxury, and commercial expansion. From the opening apostrophe, “Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain” (The Deserted Village, l. 1), the poem establishes a tableau of Platonic concord: weather-tight cottages nestle amid tilled fields; an ever-flowing brook sustains the “busy mill” and the “rustic seat beneath the hawthorn shade” (The Deserted Village, ll. 10–12); a modest church crowns the hill, presiding over labour and leisure alike. What Goldsmith mourns, therefore, is not merely scenic beauty but a vision of integrated social order—an Augustan fusion of work, worship, and communal recreation. Like other conservative humanists of the 1760s and 1770s, he frames that order as an equilibrium worth defending against the centrifugal pressures of laissez-faire modernity (Goldstein, 1977).

The harmony of Auburn is expressed repeatedly through its “mixed notes.” Milking maids sing as they work, schoolboys pour from the village school, and the watch-dog’s bark drifts across “the whispering wind” (The Deserted Village, l. 124). Each image reinforces a single ethical proposition: that labour and pleasure, discipline and spontaneity, may coexist without contradiction when grounded in shared custom (The Deserted Village, ll. 113–124). This nostalgic ethic stands apart from mere sentimental reverie; Auburn is not an escapist fantasy wrought by an isolated ego, but a collective ideal.

Yet contemporary readers were quick to question how closely Goldsmith’s idyll matched empirical reality. Thomas Comber (1770) conceded its descriptive brilliance but argued that it exaggerated the depopulation of English villages. Likewise, Thomas Babington Macaulay (1896) famously observed that Auburn “looks English so long as Goldsmith is praising it, and Irish the moment he begins to lament its ruin”—a charge that the poet had patched together two incompatible landscapes. Such criticism, far from undermining the poem, highlights the affective logic of what Boym (2001) calls restorative nostalgia: the Auburn that captivates readers is a construct, a heightened composite of memory and desire rather than an archival record.

Modern theorists of melancholia sharpen this point. Howard (2012) notes that nostalgic affect always joins a specific mnemonic object to the dream of repossession, producing an image only “partly congruent with factual history” (p. 642). Julia Kristeva (1989) adds that melancholia is driven by an “impossible mourning,” an attachment to an object that resists full expression and can never be assimilated by conscious grief (p. 13). In Goldsmith’s case, the unattainable object is the perfectly balanced village community—a form of life that enclosure has, in reality, already foreclosed. By strategically evading the harsher textures of eighteenth-century rural poverty, Village turns Auburn into an impressionistic “paradise-that-never-quite-was.” The poem therefore crystallizes the fundamental paradox of nostalgia itself: the sweetness of nostos (homecoming) coexists with the ache of algos (the pain of knowing no return is possible). Auburn’s chiming pastoral chorus thus rings not only with remembered harmony but with Goldsmith’s unfinished, perhaps unfinishable, work of mourning.

Equally, Eton evokes its own lost paradise through a verbal texture so ornate that it disengages the poem from any pretence of empirical reportage. The opening decastich—

Ye distant spires, ye antique towers,
That crown the watery glade,
Where grateful Science still adores
Her Henry’s holy Shade [...]
His silver-winding way. (Eton College, ll. 1–10)

—constitutes a miniature compendium of eighteenth-century rhetorical devices. As Spacks (1965) observes, the passage is built on a mosaic of apostrophe, chiasmus, polysyndeton, inversion, parallel triads, and carefully modulated sibilants that imitate the “silver-winding” Thames. The cumulative effect is ceremonial rather than descriptive: the syntax arches upward like the towers it names, and the repeated ye... ye... formula positions both scene and reader at a reverential distance. In Kristevan terms, the stanza is saturated with the semiotic—sonic play, rhythmic excess, a luxuriant overflow of address—that destabilizes any transparent symbolic reference to the real Eton (McAfee, 2003, pp. 13–27). Memory is not retrieved; it is re-enchanted, stylized, made strange.

By contrast, Village—though it too displays formal artistry in its heroic couplets and antithetical balances (e.g., “Ill fares the land... / Where wealth accumulates, and men decay,” The Deserted Village, ll. 51–52)—presents Auburn in a comparatively transparent narrative voice. Goldsmith’s descriptive economy, his concrete nouns and measured moral commentary, suggest an ethos of eyewitness reportage, even when the picture slides toward pastoral idealization. Eton, on the other hand, is almost allegorical from the outset: distant, antique, watery, hoary—each adjective lifts the landscape out of cartographic space and into the realm of semiotic order.

Grant (2017) notes that the lines—

Ah happy hills, ah pleasing shade,
Ah fields beloved in vain,
Where once my careless childhood stray’d,
A stranger yet to pain (Eton College, ll. 11–14)—

stage a double exposure of longing and futility. The interjection Ah establishes desire; the phrase beloved in vain instantly cancels fulfillment. Time folds curiously: the adult “I” laments from the vantage of experience, yet the syntax places the childhood self already under the sign of loss. Moments later, a “fresh’ning breeze” (Eton College, l. 15) arrives “redolent of joy and youth” (Eton College, l. 19), soothing the speaker’s weary soul even as it reminds him that such refreshment is strictly momentary. The diction oscillates between perfect recollection and foreknowledge of inevitable sorrow, so that past and present bleed into one another.

Goldsmith’s temporal grammar is sharper-edged. He uses the simple past to seal Auburn inside a completed, self-sufficient Eden (“The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm,” The Deserted Village, l. 51), then shifts to the present tense for the scene of ruin: “Sweet smiling village... thy sports are fled” (The Deserted Village, ll. 181–182). The tense break enacts a clean moral incision between “once” and “now.” Gray, however, refuses such neat lineation. His ode operates within what Kristeva would call a chronotope of irresolution: the semiotic pulse of sighs, exclamations, and disjunctive verb forms blurs chronology until the speaker can no longer be certain where childhood ends and disillusion begins (McAfee, 2003, pp. 13–15). This stylistic divergence signals two contrasting melancholic logics. Village mourns a structural loss—the extraction of a social organism from its native habitat—which can be named, dated, and (in restorative fantasy) perhaps reversed. Eton mourns a phenomenological impossibility: the adult consciousness can neither truly relive nor fully relinquish its erstwhile innocence. The ode’s internal time is recursive, always returning to the same wound; the village elegy’s time is linear, charting a fall from plenitude to vacancy.

Such differences underscore Howard’s (2012) point that nostalgic melancholia mingles a particular mnemonic object with a desire that reality can never quite satisfy (p. 642). In Eton, that object is an already spectral ideal of carefree boyhood, its substance eroded by reflection itself. In Auburn, the object is an as-if-historical community whose solidity is undermined by empirical objections yet sustained by Goldsmith’s moral urgency. Both poems thus exemplify Kristeva’s (1989) claim that melancholia centres on an un-mournable attachment: by over-aestheticizing their paradises, they expose the contradictions of nostalgia—nostos entwined with algos, sweetness forever shadowed by pain (p. 13).

Kaul (1992) observes that Eton is composed in “subjective, even idiosyncratic, heavily mannered and stylised discourse,” a rhetorical artificiality and syntactic contortion that provoked William Wordsworth’s derision (p. 72). In my view, Wordsworth overlooked the function of this very disorder in the articulation of melancholia. As Morris (2004) notes, “what is absent must be associated with pleasure or delight, and our awareness of its absence creates uneasiness” (p. 226). The speaker attempts to retrieve and re-inscribe an untainted childhood; that impulse draws him back to Eton, yet both the innocence and his veneration of the college prove irretrievable. Unable to locate in his past a “simple, violent, or original event,” he attributes present distress to Eton’s continuing presence, transplanting his current affect onto a former psychic scene (Caruth, 1996, p. 3).

Classical psychoanalytic theory, as developed by Abraham, Freud, and Melanie Klein, suggests that melancholia—much like mourning—conceals an aggressive impulse directed toward the lost object and thereby exposes the depressive subject’s underlying ambivalence (Kristeva, 1989, p. 11). Lines 51 to the end of the poem rehearse the speaker’s view of Eton’s adolescents as naïvely happy, oblivious to the sufferings yet to come: “Or pining Love shall waste their youth” (Eton College, l. 65); “Yet ah! why should they know their fate?” (Eton College, l. 95). School life is thus figured as a pitiable, transient daydream destined for future blows. Through these lines we sense the narrator’s dissatisfaction with the present, his regret, his envy of youthful innocence, and his grief at the impossibility of return. As Kristeva (1989) writes:

I love that object, but more importantly, I hate it; because I love it. I hate it because I love it, and in order not to lose it I embed it within myself; yet because I hate it, the one within is a bad self, I am bad, I am nonexistent, I must kill myself (p. 11).

Self-recrimination becomes a form of accusation against the other; the drive toward self-annihilation is a tragically displaced act of aggression (Kristeva, 1989, p. 12). Unlike Village, whose utopian nostalgia indulges and affirms a communal past, Eton constructs a fantasy memory that foregrounds absence rather than presence, designating it as “the trace of what has already disappeared” (Morris, 2004, p. 225). The poem’s centre of gravity lies in the discharge of personal affect, not in social critique: the narrator’s ambivalent rewriting of childhood turns him into the “necessary, tyrannical judge” who shields the ego from the wounds of uncompleted mourning (Kristeva, 1989, pp. 12–13).

If the home or wellspring of happiness one longs for proves, in fact, to be inaccessible, nostalgia readily degenerates into self-pity and despair (Johnson, 1750). At that point, the pleasures of recollection turn to dust, and the affective charge carried by remembered images is redirected toward time itself and the conditions of maturation. As Village observes in its meditation on Auburn—“Remembrance wakes with all her busy train, / Swells at my breast, and turns the past to pain” (The Deserted Village, l. 82)—the desire for what is past breeds suffering in the present. Hence Johnson (1750) argues that excessive dwelling on useless and painful memories hampers the free exercise of the mind; a literary work composed wholly of recollection can only be satirical, for it exposes the irrationality of nostalgia. He consistently condemns the wish to re-import an early stage of life into the present, maintaining that Providence has fixed human desires and satisfactions at irreconcilable distances, and that the work of reason is to recognise this structural separation, lest life be squandered in pursuit of impossibilities.

By contrast, poems such as Village and Eton take a different position. Unlike near-contemporary texts that register melancholia by focusing on the present—Coleridge’s Dejection: An Ode, Cowper’s The Castaway, or Hölderlin’s Half of Life (Coleridge, 2001; Cowper, 1980; Hölderlin, 1998)—Goldsmith and Gray turn their gaze backward. Through a sustained juxtaposition of present deprivation with an idealised past, they resist consigning the lost paradise to evanescence and, in so doing, expose the constitutive lack that defines the present.

Going a step further, by applying Boym’s (2001) distinction between restorative and reflective nostalgia, we can elucidate the differing functions that the two poems ascribe to lost time. In The Future of Nostalgia, Boym (2001) proposes a now-canonical differentiation between the two: restorative nostalgia “puts the emphasis on nostos (home) and proposes to rebuild the lost home and patch up the memory gaps,” whereas reflective nostalgia “dwells in algia, in longing and loss, the imperfect process of remembrance” (pp. 41–45). The first type is often conservative, sometimes militant, and “does not think of itself as nostalgic” at all, treating its project as the safeguarding of truth and tradition. The second type is self-aware, frequently playful or ironic, and ready to acknowledge that the cherished home—or the childhood, the moral order, the social community—was always, at least in part, an imaginative construction.

Placing the two poems on Boym’s spectrum can illuminate how each mobilises lost time in the service of distinct ethical and aesthetic projects. At first glance, the alignment seems straightforward: Auburn embodies restorative nostalgia, while Eton reflects. Goldsmith ends his poem with the aspiration that “Trade’s proud empire hastens to swift decay” so that the displaced poor might find a home once more (The Deserted Village, l. 430). Gray concludes, instead, with the aphoristic warning, “No more; where ignorance is bliss, / ’Tis folly to be wise” (Eton College, ll. 99–100), accepting the irreversibility of innocence lost. Yet a closer reading reveals that each poem contains crosscurrents that complicate this apparent binary. Understanding those crosscurrents allows us to see how eighteenth-century nostalgia can serve simultaneously as social critique and existential meditation, as political rhetoric and self-undoing irony.

From the opening apostrophe—“Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain” (The Deserted Village, l. 1)—Village names the object of desire as if it were a concrete, historically recoverable place. Throughout the first 200 lines, Auburn is painted in the glowing tints of a moral idyll: the schoolmaster whose “trembling voice” inspires awe yet kindness (The Deserted Village, l. 203); the parson “to all the country dear,” dividing his meagre salary among the poor (The Deserted Village, l. 145). The repeated use of the simple past tense (stood, smiled, graced) fixes these images as snapshots of a real social order that has been stolen away, not as a hazy dream. That rhetorical choice is a hallmark of restorative nostalgia: it insists on ontological solidity, a factual wholeness that could, at least in theory, be rebuilt.

Goldsmith reinforces this desire for restoration through direct moral exhortation. Roughly mid-poem, he turns from elegy to jeremiad: “Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, / Where wealth accumulates, and men decay” (The Deserted Village, ll. 51–52). The couplet is didactic, even prophetic—language chosen to arouse public action rather than to dwell contemplatively on absence. Later, the speaker addresses lawmakers (“Princes and Lords”) and enjoins them to “let not ambition mock their useful toil” (The Deserted Village, l. 393). That gesture imagines a political audience capable of reversing enclosure, curbing luxury, and reinstating village virtue. Such a programme aligns with Boym’s (2001) description of restorative nostalgia as “conspiratorial or political by nature,” a movement determined “to rebuild the lost home” (p. 13).

Yet Goldsmith’s restorative impulse is shot through with cracks. The strongest is a single, devastating recognition: “But a bold peasantry, their country’s pride, / When once destroyed, can never be supplied” (The Deserted Village, ll. 51–53). With that “never,” Goldsmith tacitly concedes that Auburn’s order is irreparable. The poem’s final tableau—exiles crossing oceans, “remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow”—makes permanent dispersal the fate of Auburn’s descendants (The Deserted Village, ll. 407–418). Restoration thus collapses into elegiac futility; nostalgia here carries a reflective undertow. It “dwells in ruins,” to borrow Boym’s (2001) phrasing, even as it brandishes the rhetoric of return.

If Goldsmith’s poem aspires but fails to reconstruct, Gray’s ode never entertains the fantasy. The speaker begins on the “stately brow / Of Windsor’s heights,” already separated from his school by both distance and adulthood (Eton College, ll. 6–7). All verbs that follow point explicitly to ephemerality: childhood gales bestow “momentary bliss” (Eton College, l. 16); “wild wit” and “rosy health” are enjoyed “Less pleasing when possessed” and “forgot as soon as shed” (Eton College, ll. 28–32). Time’s evanescence is woven into every description. No stable Auburn equivalent emerges.

When the catalogue of future afflictions arrives—“Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear, [...] keen Remorse with blood defiled”—it functions not as a call to rebuild paradise but as a memento mori that invalidates any restorationist wish (Eton College, ll. 49–68). The boys are “little victims” precisely because the poet has come to see human life as structured by inevitable loss (Eton College, l. 37). Thus, the famous final maxim does not rouse but resigns: wisdom itself is dangerous because it exposes the tragic teleology embedded in human chronology.

Still, Eton’s nostalgia is not pure reflection. For twelve lines the breeze from Eton “seems to soothe” the speaker’s weary soul (Eton College, ll. 17–28). That micro-moment enacts a miniature utopia: sensory memory almost reanimates the past. Even reflective nostalgics, Boym (2001) notes, “do not shy away from acknowledging the seductiveness of home” (p. 49). The speaker allows seduction in only to negate it: the very capacity to be momentarily soothed confirms how irretrievably he has changed. The wistful interlude proves restorative desire to be self-defeating—love that must turn against its own object.

Both poems therefore deploy nostalgia as a cultural technology rather than merely inhabiting it as sentiment. Village’s Auburn seeks to reclaim communal virtue, but the attempt founders on its own acknowledgment of irreversible historical displacement. Eton contemplates innocent delight, yet undermines it by exposing how the adult gaze annihilates childhood. Each text moves along Boym’s continuum, revealing nostalgia’s double capacity: to mobilize political moralism (restorative) and to generate philosophical melancholy (reflective).

Boym (2001) warns that unreflective restorative projects can become “explosive” when they “confuse actual home and imaginary home” (pp. 13, 41). Scholars such as Goldstein (1977) have shown how Village fed later nineteenth-century pastoralism, sometimes co-opted by reactionary ruralism that ignored real poverty. By contrast, Eton has seldom incited activism; its influence lies instead in its introspective force. Above all, we might say Village invites readers to rebuild a smashed model village, while Eton requires them to examine the shards and ponder the impossibility of glue.


**Conclusion**
This essay has approached The Deserted Village and Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College through the overarching lens of “the melancholy experience of time,” examining how nostalgia—understood as an eighteenth-century subtype of melancholia—operates within both poems. Each text foregrounds the past as a decisive point of reference and mourns its irrevocable disappearance through the lens of present pain. Both poems therefore suspend any claim to objective depiction of contemporary reality, instead dramatizing the anguish produced by an impossible return and an unappeasable longing. Yet their nostalgic modes diverge. The Deserted Village exemplifies what Svetlana Boym (2001) terms restorative nostalgia: it treats an imagined rural utopia as historical truth and implicitly entertains the hope of recovering that order in the present or future. Eton, by contrast, enacts reflective nostalgia: it openly acknowledges the past’s incompleteness and the futility of reenactment, converting remembrance into philosophical self-scrutiny. By comparing these two poems, the essay has shown that nostalgic poetry characteristically fuses three melancholic traits—fixation on the past, anguish in the present, and a future construed through the prism of loss—and thereby elucidates nostalgia’s distinctive contribution to eighteenth-century poetics of time.

Despite these insights, the present discussion remains necessarily broad. By concentrating on large-scale thematic parallels, it offers only a sketch of how nostalgic melancholia is generated at the level of poetic mechanics. Future work could profitably contract its focus: a close stylistic study might trace how metre, sound patterning, or shifts between deictic pronouns formalize distance in Eton, or how Village’s alternating heroic couplets and enjambments rhythmically stage Auburn’s rupture. Archival research could also test each poet’s “lost” landscape against parish records, enclosure maps, or Eton admission rolls, clarifying where memory tips into invention. Such micro-analyses would refine our understanding of how language itself—in its narrative sequencing, lexical choices, and rhetorical figures—manufactures the felt texture of nostalgic loss and thereby deepens the melancholy experience of time.
