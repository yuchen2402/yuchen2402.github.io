title: "Who Waits, Who Acts: Gender and Nationalism in Tibetan Exile Cinema — A Case Study of _Dreaming Lhasa_"
excerpt: "In _Herstory_ (2024), Shao Yihui turns everyday life into a quiet battleground for gender redefinition. This essay reads the film as both a feminist critique and a reflection on the fragility of modern Chinese masculinity. Through humor, tenderness, and contradiction, Herstory reveals that liberation from patriarchy is not only a women’s project—but also a man’s awakening."
