title: "Who Waits, Who Acts: Gender and Nationalism in Tibetan Exile Cinema â€” A Case Study of _Dreaming Lhasa_"
excerpt: "In _Herstory_ (2024), Shao Yihui turns everyday life into a quiet battleground for gender redefinition. This essay reads the film as both a feminist critique and a reflection on the fragility of modern Chinese masculinity. Through humor, tenderness, and contradiction, Herstory reveals that liberation from patriarchy is not only a womenâ€™s projectâ€”but also a manâ€™s awakening."
