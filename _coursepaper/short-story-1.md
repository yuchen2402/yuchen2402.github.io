**Introduction**

Herstory (2024) is a romantic drama written and directed by Shao Yihui (Douban, n.d.). The film premiered on November 22, 2024, at the Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival in China (Douban, n.d.). It achieved remarkable commercial success, grossing 700 million RMB within a month of release (HerStoryFilm, 2024). 

Set in Shanghai, Herstory (2024) follows the intertwined lives of Wang Tiemei, a single mother, her daughter Wang Moli, and their neighbor Xiaoye, while also narrating each woman’s entanglement with men of their generation. Wang Tiemei, a former journalist, now works as an editor for a feminist WeChat blog, struggling to juggle her career and single motherhood. After moving into a more affordable old building, she and her daughter befriend Xiaoye, a sound engineer who is also the lead singer of a local band. Tiemei’s ex-husband continues to cause her distress, but she eventually finds comfort in the gentle presence of Moli’s music teacher, Xiao Hu. Meanwhile, Xiaoye tries to sustain an open relationship with an ophthalmologist by lying about her feelings, but ultimately leaves the relationship after recognizing his narcissism. Moli, initially distressed by bullying from a male classmate, learns to overcome the situation with help from Tiemei, Xiaoye, and her own rhetorical skill. The film ends with the three women setting off together on a trip to France.

The film has received numerous awards, including being named one of the Top Ten Chinese-Language Films of the Year at the 17th Annual Awards (Shanghai Hongkou, 2025), and has sparked widespread discussion across Chinese society. Since the 2020s, the so-called “masculinity crisis” has become a topic of public debate in the Chinese context. While state discourse has sought to promote a revitalized ideal of yanggang zhiqi (manly spirit), younger generations—especially women—have increasingly pushed back through cultural production, expressing dissatisfaction with traditional male roles and gender expectations (Zhu et al., 2024; Zhang, 2024; Lu, 2021). Thus, this essay investigates whether and how Herstory (2024) engages in a reconfiguration of masculinity. While discussions of masculinity in Herstory (2024) have mostly appeared in journalistic reviews and online commentary, this essay aims to address a gap in academic literature by providing a more sustained critical reading of the film.

This essay begins by outlining key conceptual frameworks of masculinity in the Chinese context, before moving on to an analysis of how masculinity is represented in Herstory (2024). The study adopts a feminist perspective, drawing in particular on Kam Louie’s theoretical model of Chinese masculinities. The analysis is supported by paratextual materials related to the film, including online audience commentary and interviews with the director. Through multiple viewings of Herstory (2024), the researcher documented male characters’ interactions both with each other and with female characters, which served as the basis for critical reflection and discussion.


**Masculinity in Chinese films**

To understand how masculinity is represented in Herstory (2024), it is essential to first examine the historical trajectory of this concept within Chinese cinema.

At the theoretical level, it is useful to begin with Judith Butler’s (2006) theory of performativity, which conceptualizes the self as a constructed illusion. This essay draws on Butler’s theory to establish a theoretical foundation for reading gender discourse—not as something fixed or inherently coherent, but as a fluid and unstable process through which subjectivity is continuously negotiated and reshaped.

Secondly, although scholarly research on Chinese masculinity has historically been limited, it has grown steadily in recent years (Zhang, 2011; Osburg, 2013). Kam Louie’s (2002) framework remains central to the theorization of Chinese masculinity, particularly through his use of the wen–wu binary to conceptualize dominant masculine ideals. The wen ideal, associated with literacy, refinement, and moral cultivation, is exemplified by Confucius; in contrast, wu refers to martial prowess and directness, with Guan Yu from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms often cited as its symbolic figure (Louie, 2002, p. 24). Hu (2017) maps the shifting landscape of masculinity over the 67 years following the founding of the People’s Republic of China. While wu-oriented masculinity dominated during the Mao era, contemporary representations increasingly reflect hybrid or globalized wen-style masculinities—softer, more emotionally expressive, and diverse in character. In other words, traditional hegemonic masculine ideals may be gradually giving way to more inclusive and pluralistic alternatives.

Finally, in the context of Chinese cinema, the representation of masculinity has undergone notable historical transformations. As Song and Hird (2014) observe, early 20th-century Chinese films often portrayed men as powerful protectors and productive citizens who upheld social order—reflections of entrenched patriarchal ideals. In contrast, since the beginning of the “New Era” (post-1979), male characters have increasingly been depicted as weak, immature, self-centered, or incompetent (Zhong, 2000, p. 41). The revolutionary fervor of the mid-20th century—especially during the Maoist period—saw a narrative shift toward strong female protagonists actively participating in the socialist cause( Song & Hird, 2014). Baranovitch (2003, p. 132) notes that since at least the mid-1990s, the appeal of the macho male archetype has diminished, giving way to a resurgence of softer, more delicate male figures—a shift that many in both the West and China interpret as a feminization of masculinity.

The post-Cultural Revolution decades, particularly the rise of Fifth Generation filmmakers such as Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, brought new perspectives to male subjectivity. Films like Raise the Red Lantern (1991) and Farewell My Concubine (1993) offered complex, often ambivalent portrayals of soft masculinity. Since the mid-1990s, these more traditionally gentle and emotionally expressive male figures have gained broader cultural resonance (Hu, 2017).

In more recent years, Chinese cinema has become increasingly attentive to gender politics, with independent filmmakers and women directors taking center stage. A case in point is Send Me to the Clouds (2019), an independent production that critiques entrenched norms and offers a feminist lens on modern Chinese society. This broader cinematic evolution has laid the groundwork for Herstory (2024), which draws upon the historical trajectory of feminist discourse in Chinese film to imagine new forms of empowerment and negotiation.


**The representation of masculinity in _Herstory _(2024)**

This section begins with a brief discussion of femininity as a point of reference in the construction of masculinity. Huang (2006) argues that incorporating femininity and female figures into masculinity studies is a productive move, as it reflects the relational nature of gender. In her analysis of the role of “female others” in the making of masculinity, Huang (2006) identifies two common discursive strategies: the “strategy of analogy,” in which masculinity is validated through association with the feminine, and the “strategy of differentiation,” in which masculinity is defined in opposition to the feminine (Huang, 2006, pp. 2, 32).

See Figure 1, the promotional poster for Herstory (2024) (Sina Entertainment, 2024) offers an early glimpse into the film’s approach to masculinity. In this stylized image, the male and female characters are visually separated. The female figures dominate roughly 60% of the frame: the older women wear confident smiles and lean toward the younger girl, suggesting intergenerational solidarity. In contrast, the male characters appear isolated from one another or are shown in comic displays of physical conflict, implying that romantic attachment is not the women’s ultimate aspiration. In the bottom right corner, an intertextual reference to a Kahlo’s self-portrait (1940) further suggests that personal fulfillment for women can be achieved through independence and self-exploration, rather than submission to societal expectations.

The film conveys a clear argument: neither fictional women nor real women should be defined primarily through their relationships with men. As Song and Hird (2014) have pointed out, women in twentieth-century Chinese films served as narrative devices for male protagonists rather than as fully developed characters in their own right. In contrast, Herstory (2024) presents three women who embody independence and self-assurance: Wang Tiemei, her neighbor Xiaoye, and her daughter Wang Moli. Tiemei balances her career with single motherhood while remaining open to romantic connection. Xiaoye, having come to terms with childhood trauma, chooses to enter a clandestine relationship with an ophthalmologist while also auditioning for a singing competition. Moli, who oscillates between painting and music throughout the film, overcomes her fear of public performance and finds passion in percussion. When she asks how girls are “supposed” to play drums, Xiaoye responds, “Girls drum how you drum” (Shao, 2024, 00:42:04). Later, during a band gathering, Xiaoye expresses discomfort with open discussion of menstruation, only for Moli to boldly challenge the stigma by stating that menstruation is a natural experience for half the global population and should not be a source of shame (Ibid, 00:46:20). This ethos of self-acceptance and resistance to imposed norms runs consistently throughout the film.

Within this female-dominant narrative, male characters are portrayed as marginal, soft, and structurally disempowered. None are given full names; instead, they are referred to with simplified labels such as “the ex-husband” or “the drummer,” or by surnames like “Xiao Hu.” This reversal of nominal reduction—typically applied to female characters—exposes how reductive and dehumanizing such portrayals are when turned on men (Song, 2024). The film further renders certain male characters in exaggerated or satirical tones. One man in a baseball cap follows Xiaoye home, only to be comically chased off by Tiemei on a bicycle (Song, 2024, 00: 08: 11). Another male colleague of Tiemei is portrayed as a stereotypically effeminate gay man with a high-pitched voice (Ibid, 00: 21: 21). Even more developed male characters—such as the music teacher Xiao Hu—are shown as emotionally dependent on the women around them, while Xiaoye’s romantic partner hopes her to return after she loses interest in him (Ibid, 01: 54: 09).
Taken together, these portrayals suggest a significant weakening of traditional wu-oriented masculinity. In its place, the film presents more feminized, passive, and relational male figures embedded within a narrative structure dominated by female agency.

Some critics have accused Herstory (2024) of demeaning men, but such interpretations miss the film’ s central aim. Rather than promoting gender antagonism, the film seeks to create a space for balanced and open dialogue between men and women. Director Shao has publicly stated that she is not interested in fueling “gender wars” (Wang, 2024). Instead, Herstory (2024) foregrounds women’s lived experiences as distinct from, but not necessarily opposed to, those of men.

The film’s portrayal of gender relations is marked by inclusivity and nuance. Wang Tiemei and her ex-husband, for instance, maintain a cooperative co-parenting relationship after divorce. Far from hostile exes, they share a relatively amicable dynamic that may challenge more traditional notions of family and parental roles. Their “parent-friendship” reflects an alternative form of post-marital intimacy that feels both emotionally credible and socially forward-looking. Similarly, the relationship between Xiaoye and the ophthalmologist Xiao Hu resists conventional romantic tropes. They enjoy physical intimacy without the obligations typically associated with committed relationships. The film embraces this complexity rather than judging it. Moreover, the film’ s inclusive spirit surfaces in subtle narrative moments. For example, when Tiemei’s ex-husband runs into her new suitor Xiao Ma while taking out the trash, both characters encounter a queer couple in the alleyway without incident (Shao, 2024, 01:07: 03). Or when Xiao Hu mistakenly believes Tiemei and Xiaoye are in a romantic relationship, his reaction is not hostile or judgmental but quietly perplexed and eventually accepting (Ibid, 01:27: 05). These narrative details reinforce Herstory (2024) ‘s commitment to portraying pluralism in gender and intimacy.

The film illustrates how both men and women are subject to rigid expectations under patriarchy: men are pressured to succeed professionally, while women are expected to excel within the domestic sphere. For example, when confronted by a barrage of questions from Wang Tiemei’s ex-husband, Xiao Hu reveals that he plays multiple instruments—including the harp, saxophone, and xiao (a traditional Chinese flute) (Ibid, 00:24:45). Later, during a social gathering, Moli casually mentions that Xiao Hu’s mother passed away years ago, prompting him to explain that he had to learn all these instruments out of necessity in order to live independently (Ibid, 00:48:01). Through characters like the ex-husband and Xiao Hu, the film works to bridge opposing gender positions and invites male characters into feminist conversations. It acknowledges that men, too, experience structural pressures—particularly the culturally ingrained demand to “make something of themselves.” Rather than portraying men simply as oppressors, Herstory (2024) shows that the patriarchal system places burdens on all genders, creating a shared but unequally distributed struggle to meet socially sanctioned ideals.

Herstory (2024) portrays not only an awakened sense of femininity, but also an emerging, self-reflective form of masculinity. The male characters retain traces of toxic masculinity, yet they also show signs of breaking away from traditional gender norms. Wang Tiemei’s ex-husband, for example, was once a stay-at-home father, but ultimately succumbed to social prejudice against women who prioritize their careers. He chose to divorce Tiemei, only to later realize her value and attempt to win her back by performing a self-proclaimed feminist stance (Shao, 2024, 00:05:06). His character illustrates the ambivalence many men face in the process of gender equality: a desire to reject patriarchal expectations, tempered by deep-rooted social pressures and a fragile sense of identity. Xiao Hu, the ophthalmologist, embodies a laid-back, seemingly egalitarian attitude toward gender and relationships. He avoids judging Xiaoye for her relationship with Tiemei, and does not impose possessive expectations on her (Ibid, 00:35:35, 01:27:09). However, when he mistakenly believes that Xiaoye has attempted suicide out of love for him, his narcissistic masculinity surfaces. Ignoring her explanation that she simply had a cold, he indulges in a self-important monologue, revealing his latent egocentrism (Ibid, 01:39:54). Xiao Ma, another male character who explicitly seeks to break with patriarchal norms, also exhibits residual patterns of entitlement. Influenced by misogynistic portrayals in pornography, he tears Tiemei’s underwear during a sexual encounter—an act that exposes how ingrained some forms of male aggression remain (Ibid, 01:00:27). Still, the film treats these moments not as irredeemable offenses, but as indicators of fumbling progress. As Tiemei says in one scene, “We need to give young people a chance—we need to give this kind of man a chance” (Ibid, 01:21:03). Xiao Ma’s willingness to listen, his humility, and his efforts to understand women's perspectives ultimately earn him what Tiemei jokingly calls a “ten-minute recess” in their relationship—a symbol of cautious but possible mutual trust.

Narratively, Herstory (2024) employs humor and metaphor to render its critique of toxic masculinity both accessible and engaging. As director Shao Yihui has remarked, the film “lacks dramatic intensity—it is distilled from everyday life” (Wang, 2024). One illustrative example is a dinner scene in which Tiemei’s ex-husband and her potential suitor, Xiao Hu, engage in a verbal showdown. Each tries to demonstrate that he has transcended patriarchal norms and male privilege, going so far as to cite contemporary feminist texts—including works by Japanese feminist scholar Chizuko Ueno—to prove his ideological “awakening” (Shao, 2024, 01:04:50–01:06:26).Moli, watching the exchange, innocently asks why the two men are arguing so intensely. Tiemei responds, “They’re competing over masculinity,” to which Xiaoye adds bluntly, “That’s a toxic thing” (Ibid, 01:05:50). This moment satirizes the performative nature of modern male “wokeness” while subtly criticizing what Hu (2017) has referred to as wu-style masculinity—characterized by aggressive assertion, dominance, and competition among men. The film thus exposes the contradictions in male attempts to appear enlightened while still participating in symbolic power struggles.

In addition, one of the film’s most memorable sequences is a sound montage in which Xiaoye asks Moli to wear headphones and guess the origins of several recorded sounds. Everyday noises made by Tiemei while doing housework are reimagined as natural phenomena: the sound of frying eggs in the kitchen becomes a “thunderstorm”; flicking water off laundry on the balcony evokes “lightning”; the hum of a vacuum cleaner is described as a “tornado”; vegetables tossed into water sound like “dolphins diving into the sea”; and the clatter of toys being picked up is likened to the roar of an “excavator” (Shao, 2024, 00:31:30–00:33:40). Through this imaginative and grounded storytelling technique, director Shao Yihui subtly conveys one of the film’s core messages: gender politics are not always embedded in overt ideological confrontation, but are often woven into the unnoticed rhythms of daily life.

However, Herstory (2024) is not without its missteps in its critique of toxic masculinity. At times, the film risks overstating its message, particularly in its portrayal of school life through the character of Zhang Jiaxin, a male classmate who is painted with an array of negative traits and is shown repeatedly bullying Wang Moli. In one notable scene, during a class meeting to elect the Chinese language class representative, Zhang raises his hand to “tattle” on Moli, claiming she often arrives late and eats instant noodles in the classroom. The female teacher responds with thinly veiled sarcasm: “And what does that have to do with her being class representative?” She then quietly mocks Zhang with the question, “Who taught you to report people?” The scene ends with the teacher writing the Chinese characters for “informing” (举报) on the blackboard and announcing, “Today we’ll learn what it means to report someone.”
Research on tattling behavior suggests that the film’s treatment of the issue may oversimplify a more complex developmental and social process. Ingram (2014) notes that as children mature, they tend to shift from physical aggression—which carries a high risk of retaliation—to indirect forms of protest, such as reporting to authority figures. This transition is often a strategic move toward safer and more socially acceptable conflict management. Similarly, Yucel and Vaish (2018) argue that tattling among children is not merely self-serving; it frequently serves a cooperative social function, helping to uphold shared moral norms. Zeng (2024), in an informal consultation with several experienced primary school teachers, found that tattling is generally tolerated—and even tacitly encouraged—in classroom settings. Teachers offered three main justifications: first, younger children often experience interpersonal conflict, and reporting to a teacher can prevent escalation; second, allowing children to report problems helps them build a habit of seeking adult intervention when hurt; and third, tattling fosters peer accountability by enabling students to monitor one another’s behavior. In this light, tattling can serve not just as a form of self-protection, but also as a means of appealing for justice, regulating social norms, and maintaining classroom order.

Based on existing research, a more balanced continuation of this scene would have shown the teacher guiding the students in understanding the appropriate contexts for reporting behavior. She might have explained that while it is important to speak up about genuine concerns, tattling should not be used as a tool to undermine or target others. In this case, the boy should not have used his report to challenge Wang Moli’s eligibility for class representative, and Moli, for her part, should not have been eating snacks during class. After mediation, she could still have been allowed to participate in the election process. Such a resolution would have reinforced the value of fairness, accountability, and restorative dialogue, rather than framing the act of reporting as inherently shameful or manipulative.

While Wang Moli symbolizes a future-oriented vision of girlhood—“optimistic and confident enough to confront tragedy”—the film’s portrayals of her father and Xiao Ma show male characters tentatively working to shed toxic masculinity. However, the depiction of the schoolboy Zhang Jiaxin, who is marked by prejudice and, arguably, unconscious malice, suggests that the director’s view of the younger generation of boys may be overly pessimistic. It is clear that the film’s intent is to critique hegemonic masculinity. Yet in doing so, it places an underage boy in the crosshairs of both adult mockery and institutional correction, particularly through the figure of the female teacher, who unambiguously sides with Moli. This dynamic risks crossing into a reverse form of symbolic bullying—this time targeting a young male figure. What complicates the issue further is that the boy continues to be portrayed negatively in several additional scenes, reinforcing a sense of unexamined bias.
Therefore, if the film chooses not to engage with these widely acknowledged pedagogical principles, it should also refrain from disproportionately burdening a boy—roughly the same age as Wang Moli—with an excess of negative labels. In fact, this child character is portrayed with more overt negativity than any of the adult male characters in the film, which raises concerns about representational imbalance.


**Significance of the representation**

Given the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) tight control over media content, the relatively smooth approval and limited censorship of Herstory (2024) is worth examining. Several factors may have contributed to the film’s successful release, and analyzing these factors sheds light on the broader significance of how masculinity is represented in the film. First, its narrative critiques social issues without directly challenging state policy, situating conflict in the realm of personal and societal transformation rather than systemic opposition. Second, the CCP has shown strategic tolerance for content promoting family values and controlled discussions of issues like domestic violence, which align with its broader agenda of social harmony. Third, amid economic slowdown and weak box office returns, attracting female viewers—who make up about 58% of China’s moviegoers—has become a commercial priority (Sohu News, 2024). The success of female-driven films like YOLO (2024) and Lost in the Stars (2022) has confirmed the market potential of this demographic. Allowing a film like Herstory (2024) to reach theaters may also serve the state’s interest in projecting a more inclusive and progressive image, both domestically and abroad.

Additionally, audience reception—particularly among male viewers—offers insight into resistance to reversed gender narratives. On Hupu, a male-dominated online forum (with over 90% male users), Herstory (2024) received a low rating of 5 out of 10. Many users openly criticized the film’s portrayal of men competing for female attention and dismissed it as empty and overly talkative (Laogemen Nengbuneng Youlong, 2024). One user claimed that none of the male characters were “normal,” portraying men as mere tools for women (JR1091031287, 2024). Another mockingly responded to a defense of the film by calling its male supporters “turtles,” writing: “The turtle’s circle must be all turtles” (Sixiangkuaiche, 2024). These reactions suggest that while inclusive and “soft” masculinities are gaining visibility in Chinese cinema, many male viewers are not ready to relinquish symbolic power. As Louie (2002) has argued, even “gentle” masculinities often carry an implicit demand to succeed within gendered and market hierarchies. In this sense, Herstory (2024) ’s attempt to reimagine masculinity through a feminist lens may alienate male audiences who still cling to narratives of male dominance. The film’s poor reception on male-centered platforms indicates the limited persuasive power such gender reversals currently hold over traditional male spectatorship.


**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this essay has offered a critical analysis of the representation of masculinity in the Chinese film Herstory (2024), examining its nuanced portrayal of gender roles and its engagement with contemporary feminist discourse. By placing male characters in subordinate or peripheral roles, the film subverts traditional constructions of masculinity and reflects China’s evolving gender landscape. Through characters such as Wang Tiemei’s ex-husband, Xiaoye’s romantic partner, and Wang Moli’s classmate, the film critiques hegemonic masculinity while depicting emerging, more inclusive forms of male identity.

The significance of Herstory (2024) lies not only in its commercial success but also in its resonance with current feminist and social concerns in China. Rather than simply reversing gender roles, the film encourages reflection on how patriarchal structures constrain both men and women. By portraying male vulnerability and awkward but sincere efforts at self-redefinition, the film reinforces a key feminist premise: that gender equality can also liberate men.

That said, the film’s representation is not without controversy. Certain narrative choices—particularly its portrayal of a school-aged boy in a sharply negative light—reveal the potential pitfalls of gender critique. In critiquing toxic masculinity, the film at times risks reinforcing reductive stereotypes. Furthermore, audience reception highlights deep divisions in how gender is perceived and negotiated, especially among male viewers. Critical backlash on male-dominated platforms like Hupu points to the ongoing tension between progressive gender portrayals and entrenched expectations of male authority.

Herstory (2024) serves as a valuable case study for understanding the shifting dynamics of masculinity in contemporary Chinese cinema. Its portrayal reflects both the advances and resistances in broader cultural acceptance of gender equity, offering fertile ground for future academic inquiry into masculinity, feminism, and media representation in East Asia.
