**1. Introduction** 
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 triggered drastic transformations in human interaction, cultural production, and media consumption (Huddleson, 2023). For theatre audiences in particular, the global health crisis accelerated the proliferation of recorded performances on streaming platforms, enabling access to staged productions across geographies without physical presence (Di Ponio, 2023; Fuchs, Boles, & Hartl, 2021). Among such platforms, Globe Player and Digital Theatre gained wide international attention(Di Ponio, 2023). Launched by Shakespeare‚Äôs Globe in 2014, Globe Player was the first theatre-run digital service offering full-length recordings for streaming, rental, or download‚Äîdesigned to extend theatrical access to a global public (Press Association, 2014). In contrast, Digital Theatre developed a subscription-based platform in collaboration with leading UK institutions such as the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Opera House, providing curated, high-quality recordings supplemented by educational content (Di Ponio, 2023).

Yet the expansion of these services raises critical questions about the transformation of theatre as a cultural form in digital contexts. As theorists such as Kittler and Butler (2014) have argued, technological media increasingly shape everyday perception, creating a world in which all experience is potentially mediated. Auslander (2008) further asserts that live performance has become indistinguishable from its media representations‚Äîwhat once defined ‚Äúliveness‚Äù is now filtered, constructed, or displaced by media systems. 

This paper, drawing on theories of platformization and mediatization, takes Digital Theatre and Globe Player as two case studies to examine the relationship between digital platforms and live theatrical performance as creative work. It asks: can platform-based recordings genuinely replicate the experience of live performance? And in what ways do such platforms alter our cultural understanding of theatrical ontology and spectatorship? I will reject the inherent opposition and instead advocate for an approach that emphasizes both the mutual influence and the interdependence between liveness and its mediatisation through digital platforms.


**2. Mediatiszation, liveness and platformisation**
Because the terms mediation, mediatization, and liveness have long lacked stable definitions in media and performance theory, it is necessary to first clarify their conceptual foundations before analysing how digital platforms reshape theatrical experience. Moreover, as this paper investigates two specific examples‚ÄîGlobe Player and Digital Theatre‚Äîit is also essential to define what constitutes a digital platform and to demonstrate how these services qualify as such.

Media are neither entirely transparent conduits nor fully tangible objects; they oscillate between visibility and invisibility depending on context (Enns, 2015). Meanwhile,  ‚Äúthe media occupies the intervening space between the sender and the receiver, and it is able to facilitate their connection while still maintaining the distance that separates them‚Äù (Enns, 2015, p.13). Bolter and Grusin's (2000) theory of remediation further complicates this relationship by introducing the ‚Äúdouble logic‚Äù of immediacy and hypermediacy. Within this theoretical framework, media function as crucial instruments that connect spatial or conceptual divides, forming the foundational condition for the emergence of culture and community. At the same time, however, the very act of mediation maintains the separation it bridges‚Äîsince the existence of a medium necessarily points to a distance that prevents complete unity.

This paper adopts Auslander‚Äôs(2008) interpretation of mediatization, which in turn draws on concepts developed by Baudrillard (1983). Drawing on Baudrillard (1983), Auslander (2008, p.17) defines mediatization as the incorporation of performance into mass-mediated systems‚Äîspecifically through technologies of recording, transmission, and replay . For Auslander, mediatization refers not only to the technical reproduction of events but to the broader aesthetic, formal, and epistemological influence that media exert on live performance (Auslander, 2008, pp.17-18). This includes the televisual framing of theatre, amplification of sound, projection of video, or even the re-staging of events specifically for later media dissemination. In this paper, I use mediatization to refer to the technologically mediated representation of theatre via digital platforms‚Äîrecorded, encoded, and framed for non-co-present audiences.

Liveness, meanwhile, is often cited as the ontological core of theatre. The presence of performers and spectators ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù has been widely assumed to distinguish theatre from mediated forms such as film and television(Pilavcƒ±, 2024, p.70). Peggy Phelan (1996, p.146) famously argued that performance ‚Äúcannot be saved, recorded, documented, or otherwise participate in the circulation of representations‚Äù‚Äîa position that insists on the ephemeral, unrepeatable nature of performance. However, the binary opposition between liveness and mediatization needs to be questioned. Auslander (2008, p.63) argues that liveness itself has become a culturally produced effect, no longer tied to temporal co-presence but constructed through conventions, expectations, and media logics. In other words, media have not entirely eliminated or overturned liveness, but have instead reconstructed it. At the same time, live performance gains a sense of authenticity through its mediated representation.

Globe Player and Digital Theatre exemplify different strategies of mediating liveness. To evaluate their operation, we must also define digital platforms. Following Poell, Nieborg, and van Dijck (2019), digital platforms are programmable infrastructures that organise cultural activity through data extraction, algorithmic governance, and economic monetization. They act as socio-technical systems that structure interaction between users and ‚Äúcomplementors‚Äù‚Äîhere, theatre institutions, performers, and audiences. Both Globe Player and Digital Theatre meet these conditions. They mediate between cultural producers and global users, shape theatrical content via platform-specific models (rental versus subscription, static archive versus curated rotation), and encode performance into monetizable digital artefacts. 

This paper therefore adopts a dual framework: mediatization as the aesthetic and formal transformation of theatrical liveness through recording technologies, and platformization as the structural and economic reconfiguration of creative work under digital capitalism. The intersection of these two processes offers a critical site for examining how digital media reshape not only the form of performance but also the conditions of its production, circulation, and reception.


**3. Case Study 1: Digital Theatre**
Digital Theatre makes no attempt to conceal its ambition to reconstruct the experience of theatrical liveness. Since its launch in 2009, it has marketed itself with the promise of ‚ÄúYour online home of world-class theatre, streamed directly to your sofa‚Äù (Digital Theatre, 2025). However, this kind of marketing is questionable: can audiences truly experience the same sense of liveness on their sofa through a digital platform as they would in a theatre? What exactly is the nature of the experience they are having? In this section, we will examine how Digital Theatre attempts to construct mediatized liveness, while the outcomes of this strategy will be discussed in Chapter Four, the comparison section.

Frist of all, according to Robert Delamere (cited in Girvan, 2012), co-founder of Digital Theatre, the platform's recording method involves the use of remotely operated cameras within the theatre space, eliminating the need to remove audience seating or film in an empty auditorium. This approach is designed to preserve the live audience experience as much as possible, minimizing disruption to both the performance and the spectators. As Delamere (cited in Girvan, 2012) explains, ‚ÄúWe tend to shoot successive performances‚Äîmaybe a matinee and an evening, or two evenings in a run‚Äîand then we essentially apply film editing techniques and the language of cinema to try to recapture every moment of the live theatre experience‚Äù (cited in Grivan, 2012). However, this also implies that what audiences see on the platform may be a composite of footage drawn from multiple performances. ‚ÄúWe might do a matinee and then one or two evenings in the run,‚Äù Delamere (cited in Grivan, 2012) adds, ‚Äúand then we basically apply film-editing techniques, using the language of cinema to try and recapture the authenticity of every moment of the live theatre experience‚Äù.

Second, Digital Theatre‚Äôs recordings often include close-ups, low-angle shots, and cinematic compositions that guide the viewer‚Äôs gaze and emotional attention. Hunter (1949, p. 47) states that the simultaneous use of three to five cameras in a multi-camera setup‚Äîstill the standard shooting method for television studio productions‚Äîwas developed out of a desire to replicate the visual discourse of the theatrical experience from the audience‚Äôs perspective. This visual strategy moves far beyond neutral documentation, operating instead as remediation‚Äîa process by which theatrical performance is reconfigured into a media artefact aligned with audiovisual grammar. The resulting experience is not that of the original live event but of a mediated simulation, shaped by editorial choices that interrupt the spatial continuity and embodied presence of the stage. As Auslander (2008) argues, mediatization is not an auxiliary tool applied to live performance but a structural transformation that can subsume and redefine liveness altogether.

Third, Digital Theatre‚Äôs interface design and technical architecture reinforce this substitution. On the platform, users are unable to take screenshots or record the screen through standard methods. While this can be interpreted as a copyright measure, it more fundamentally signals the platform‚Äôs control over the act of viewing itself. Watching becomes a regulated event, stripped of reproducibility or user agency. The blocking of screenshots symbolically denies viewers the right to extract, annotate, or circulate visual content‚Äîtransforming the act of viewing from a participatory cultural practice into a one-directional, non-transferable act of consumption.

Finally, further amplifying this logic is the platform‚Äôs ‚Äúlimited-time access‚Äù model, in which each production remains available for approximately six weeks (Woollard, 2010). This creates an artificial sense of urgency akin to live broadcasting. Although not truly synchronous, the temporal restriction mimics the ephemerality of live theatre, converting liveness into a behavioural script governed by platform rhythm. Here, immediacy is not a function of co-temporality but a designed affect, crafted through scheduling, scarcity, and the symbolic performance of ‚Äúnow-ness.‚Äù


**4. Case Study 2: Globe Player**
In contrast to Digital Theatre, Globe Player makes no claim that renting, owning, or streaming its cultural recordings can substitute the embodied experience of attending a live performance. I think Globe Player positions itself as a repository for historical performance documentation, rather than a medium for simulating immediacy or co-presence. One reason is that, unlike Digital Theatre‚Äôs pseudo-live release schedule, each production on Globe Player is available for long-term access‚Äîeither through individual permanent purchase or via an annual pass granting access to the full catalogue. This aligns with Doylen‚Äôs (2001, p. 352) definition of an archive as ‚Äúrecords created or received by a person, family, or organization and preserved because of their continuing value.‚Äù

Furthermore, the platform‚Äôs interface reflects this archival orientation. It lacks algorithmic recommendation systems or curated homepage content; updates are infrequent, and the overall design prioritizes the referential function of the recordings over temporal urgency. Notably, Globe Player allows users to take screenshots freely‚Äîa technical openness that not only reflects a more permissive copyright policy, but also reveals a different conception of the viewing experience. Performances are treated not as proprietary, unreplicable commodities tied to a specific context, but as reusable cultural resources‚Äîavailable for preservation, analysis, citation, and pedagogical reuse. This reduced control over viewing pathways signals a deliberate retreat from platform-mediated spectatorship: Globe Player does not seek to dictate how or when content should be consumed, but instead leaves that agency to the user.

In terms of visual style, Globe Player preserves the spatial and corporeal structure of the theatrical stage. Filming typically involves static, wide, and mid-range shots from fixed cameras. The editing is restrained, avoiding intrusive cuts or dynamic framing, and thus refrains from manipulating the viewer‚Äôs visual or emotional attention. This approach reflects Kr√§mer‚Äôs (2015, pp. 25-30) concept of "media marginalism," which assumes that media are neutral and barely perceptible phenomena that do not affect the content they transmit. According to this view, media are secondary to the message or content they convey. In other words, it presupposes the existence of an unalterable live performance outside of media‚Äîaccessible through mediation, but neither constituted nor transformed by it.

From a media-theoretical perspective, Globe Player exemplifies what Bolter and Grusin term hypermediacy: the medium does not conceal its own presence, but rather foregrounds its materiality through visible interfaces, controllable progress bars, and open screenshot functionality. What is being watched is not a hidden or seamless theatre event, but a self-evidently mediated performance. It is more visible, more controlled, and more archivally legible. The platform does not simulate the theatre; it transforms it into part of a knowledge system, emphasizing repeatability, accessibility, and pedagogical potential. Its form of liveness is not defined by temporal co-presence but by what could be called deferred presence‚Äîa temporally displaced yet structurally preserved mode of engagement sustained through recording and documentation.


**5. Comparison**
As demonstrated through the analysis of Digital Theatre and Globe Player, recordings of live performances on digital platforms inherently exist as derivatives rather than as authentic enactments of creative works. Both platforms fundamentally translate theatre‚Äôs intrinsic ephemerality into reproducible digital forms, resulting in mediated artifacts rather than immediate performances. Richard Schechner (2006) argues that if we fail to recognize the ritualistic aspects of commercial live performance‚Äîincluding the practices of rehearsal, the backstage routines before, during, and after a show, the social functions performed by each actor in their broader life context, the financial investment of backstage supporters, the arrival of the audience, and even the act of purchasing a ticket‚Äîwe overlook the deeper structures that define theatre as a socially embedded and meaning-generating practice. Reflecting on responses to her survey conducted after a live-streamed performance of A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream by the Globe Theatre, Erin Sullivan (as cited in Henderson, 2024) observes that participants clearly indicated a preference for attending the performance in person, had that option been available, and emphasized the broader value of live, in-person theatre.  In this context, viewers accessing theatre via these platforms experience recordings devoid of the spatial co-presence and temporal immediacy that define theatrical liveness, confirming Phelan‚Äôs critique that performance, once recorded, ceases to be performance in its original, authentic sense.

Yet, as Auslander (2008) argues, mediatization and liveness are mutually reinforcing rather than exclusively detrimental. Although recordings of performances may initially appear subordinate or secondary, they acquire legitimacy precisely through reference to an original live event. Viewers implicitly understand recorded content as evidence of an authentic, embodied performance, reinforcing the assumption of theatre‚Äôs fundamental liveness. In turn, contemporary live events frequently adopt media conventions, styles, and expectations first established by recorded and broadcast performances, creating a feedback loop that challenges rigid distinctions between ‚Äúlive‚Äù and ‚Äúmediated.‚Äù

Digital Theatre exemplifies Auslander‚Äôs (2008) concept of mediatized liveness, consciously employing technological means to reconstruct theatre‚Äôs perceived immediacy, actively framing the viewer‚Äôs emotional and sensory engagement. Its practices blur traditional theatrical ontology, producing an experience structured by platform interfaces, controlled access, and orchestrated viewing patterns. In contrast, Globe Player engages viewers through explicit hypermediacy, openly displaying its archival, mediated form. Rather than manufacturing immediacy, it emphasizes a critical awareness of the performance as a cultural artifact‚Äîpreserved, documented, and reusable. Globe Player‚Äôs archival logic thus positions itself as a repository rather than a producer, intervening minimally in the creative process, unlike Digital Theatre‚Äôs intentional reshaping of theatrical content through media technologies.
Ultimately, both platforms demonstrate how digital media reshape theatrical liveness, yet they differ significantly in their strategies and implications. Digital Theatre actively reconstructs liveness as a consumable experience governed by platform logic, while Globe Player preserves liveness as an archival resource, transparently mediated yet culturally accessible. Their distinct approaches exemplify competing understandings of digital mediation: one oriented toward simulating and commodifying theatrical immediacy, the other towards maintaining critical distance and documentary authenticity.


**Conclusion**
In conclusion, this paper rejects a simplistic binary between liveness and mediatization, arguing instead that digital platforms do not "replace" live theatre but actively construct new modes of spectatorship and aesthetic experience through specific strategies of mediation. The analysis of Digital Theatre and Globe Player demonstrates that liveness is not a natural property of performance, but a viewing effect that is strategically constructed by media aesthetics and institutionally governed by platform infrastructures.

The two platforms reveal divergent logics of cultural mediation. Digital Theatre exemplifies a commercial reconfiguration of audience-performer relationships, transforming theatrical performance into a quantifiable, predictable, and updatable media product. This aligns with what Nick Srnicek (2016) identifies as the logic of platform capitalism‚Äîwhere platforms serve as coordinators of labour, orchestrators of consumption, and managers of cultural meaning. In contrast, Globe Player operates more like a cultural archive. It does not dictate modes of viewing or patterns of consumption, but instead offers stabilized access to past performances, encouraging use for study, research, and reproduction. This distinction highlights two dominant orientations in the relationship between digital platforms and cultural/creative work: one that produces viewing experiences, and another that preserves them; one that simulates presence, and another that catalogues absence.

However, this study also has certain limitations, both theoretical and empirical. Due to restricted access to platform operations, user data, and internal production workflows, the current analysis is necessarily limited to visible content and paratexts. It does not fully address deeper structural issues such as algorithmic governance, revenue distribution, or labour contracts within these platforms. Furthermore, the focus has remained on the viewing experience rather than the entire production chain, including rehearsal, filming, and post-production curation.

Future research could expand in several directions. One promising avenue is to investigate the internal governance structures of platforms, particularly how they shape the visibility and value of creative labour. Another would be to broaden the scope to include other types of digital cultural platforms‚Äîsuch as educational or experimental theatre initiatives‚Äîto explore how platformised liveness manifests across varied cultural contexts and institutional aims.
