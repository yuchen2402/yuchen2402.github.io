title: "Restorative Dreams, Reflective Realities: The Politics of Nostalgia in Hong Kong Film"
excerpt: "Abstract: This paper explores restorative and reflective nostalgia in _Comrades: Almost a Love Story_ (1996) and _Made in Hong Kong_ (1997), drawing on Svetlana Boym’s theory to examine how both films construct and critique historical memory around the 1997 Handover. It argues that Hong Kong’s nostalgic cinema functions simultaneously as emotional refuge and cultural critique, revealing the city’s political and psychological anxieties amid transition.(MA coursework essay, _Cultural Memory_, King’s College London.)"

**1. Introduction**
“The rewriting of history itself is never without an agenda” (Lee, 2008, p. 8). The creation of historical narratives is often shaped by prevailing socio-political contexts and frequently reflects present-day motivations. Therefore, when nostalgia becomes a prominent trend, it is essential to critically analyze its connection to contemporary societal dynamics.

Since the nineteenth century, nostalgia—defined as “a yearning for the lost past and an escape from the present”—has been seen as a response to the challenges of modernity (Boym, 2002). Huffer (1998) argues that nostalgia, at its core, is conservative due to its resistance to change. It has also been critiqued for its lack of authenticity, producing a distorted version of historical events that can obscure our understanding of political and social realities. However, nostalgia’s potential for critical engagement has also been recognized. For instance, Cook (2005) contends that nostalgia can inspire viewers to rethink and reflect on the past.

Boym (2002) theorizes that nostalgia can be categorized into two types: restorative and reflective. Restorative nostalgia is unconscious of its idealizing process; it naively (or manipulatively) equates the idealized image with a realistic historical condition, perceiving itself as “truth and tradition” (Boym, 2007, p. 13). Its intention is not simply to represent a desire for the past but to recreate it as it “used to be,” presuming a wish to relive it in the same form. In contrast, reflective nostalgia does not focus on searching for home or roots. Instead, it adopts a distant or ironic perspective, emphasizing a meditation on history and the passage of time. It problematizes the relationship between past, present, and future, challenging the linearity of historical narratives. While restorative nostalgia enforces patriotism and national spirit, reflective nostalgia questions and challenges these constructs, opening up multiple possibilities and alternative interpretations of historical development (Boym, 2002, pp. 49–50).

Visual media, described as the "chief carrier of historical messages in our culture," serves as a legitimate platform for historicizing (Rosenstone, 1994, p. 3). Despite its unofficial status, cinema is important in historicizing, and nostalgic cinema has the historicizing power of fiction. In Hong Kong, cinema is seen as the core platform of Hong Kong culture, identity, and even history (Lok, 2002; Ma, 2007). During the 1980s and 1990s, Hong Kong cinema experienced a wave of nostalgia (Li, 1993; Chan, 2000), which gradually became a dominant theme in the market.

Chow (1999) argues that the reading of Hong Kong cinema in Western academia often leans toward reflectionism, assuming that films produced around the 1997 handover are inherently socio-political documents reflecting political changes. This approach presumes that all films adopt a critical stance toward history and politics. To refine this framework, the discussion primarily draws on Boym's theory, analyzing the narrative structure of Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) as a case study of restorative nostalgia. By contrasting it with the reflective nostalgia portrayed in Made in Hong Kong (1997), the discussion tends to treat these forms of nostalgia as cultural pathologies that reflect Hong Kong’s political predicament, demonstrating that nostalgia can serve both as a social utopia and as a call to historical reflection.

**2. Restorative Nostalgia in Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996)**
Boym's theory of restorative nostalgia emphasizes addressing identity crises by reconstructing the "lost home." On the one hand, the film reconstructs Hong Kong's golden era through the recreation of cultural symbols and historical events. Nostalgia is described as "a wistful mood that may be prompted by an object, a scene, a smell, or a strain of music" (Belk, 1990, p. 670). As a representative work of the nostalgic trend in 1990s Hong Kong cinema, Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996), directed by Peter Chan, meticulously incorporates visual and auditory details such as pagers, military uniforms, and the song Nothing to My Name. As Jun painfully leaves a message for Li Qiao, saying, "Please tell the owner of this pager, goodbye,"the TV is playing the sensational 1989 TVB drama The Greed of Man (Comrades: Almost a Love Story, 1996, 56: 59 ). On her aunt's wall are clippings of news reports about William Holden's visit to Hong Kong(5: 10). During the Hong Kong stock market boom, even the mainland immigrant Li Qiao knew that "stocks are Hong Kong's specialty."(38: 21)  However, the stock market crash eventually turned Li Qiao into a person with negative equity. This approach attempts a transhistorical reconstruction of the lost home (Boym, 2002). Particularly, Teng's song Tian Mi Mi (1979) which serves as a recurring motif throughout the film, triggers "involuntary autobiographical memories" of Hong Kong's golden era (Howard, 2012, p. 643), specifically the decade preceding the handover, when the 1980s marked a period of rapid economic prosperity and the flourishing of Hong Kong cinema.

Figure 1  Li Xiao-Jun rides his bicycle with Li Qiao while they hum Teng's song Tian Mi Mi (1979),  evoking the audience's nostalgia for 1980s Hong Kong (Comrades: Almost a Love Story，1996, 17: 13).

On the other hand, Hong Kong, as a society shaped by immigration and cross-cultural identities, has produced a nostalgic narrative that not only revives local memory but also reflects the "cultural hybridity" (Bhabha, 1994). At the beginning of the film, Li Qiao deceives Li Xiao-Jun by claiming she is a Hong Kong native. However, on a night when she has been drinking, she finally admits, "I’m from Guangzhou." "I already guessed that. We’re comrades!" "Comrades, my foot! We speak Cantonese, we watch Hong Kong videos, we drink Vitasoy. We’re so close to Hong Kong" (Comrades: Almost a Love Story, 1996, 24:53). Later, when Li Qiao achieves success, she says, "I told my mom I finally became a Hong Konger, but sadly, she can no longer hear me." (01:08:53) While Li Qiao struggles to become a Hong Konger, her success ultimately comes at the cost of losing the opportunity to reunite with her mother in Guangzhou. Similarly, mainland immigrants who endure countless hardships to integrate into Hong Kong’s hybrid culture often find themselves losing the roots of their identity tied to the mainland. The film does more than romanticize the past—it revisits and reconstructs identity and historical ruptures through cultural symbols, offering a complex exploration of these intertwined themes.

The continuous acceleration of social change has made our relationships to each other and the world increasingly fluid and problematic (Rosa, 2002). Nostalgia is thus seen as a counter-acceleration mechanism (Brewer, 2024). Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) extends the nostalgic trend of late 1980s Hong Kong cinema, embodying one of the core elements of restorative nostalgia—the return to origins (Boym, 2001, p. 41). The figure of Teng Li-chun symbolizes the spiritual dislocation of Hong Kong’s people, and her identity, straddling Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, provides an emotional anchor for viewers (Zhang, 2008). Additionally, Hong Kong is a quintessential immigrant city, evolving from a small fishing village to a bustling metropolis, with its population primarily comprising waves of new and old migrants from mainland China and their descendants. Li Qiao’s frantic efforts to adapt to her new environment exemplify the spirit of perseverance and resilience, reflecting the "Hong Kong spirit" embraced by generations of residents, including both old and new immigrants.

Furthermore, a nation is built through imagined communities, which rely on books and media for their creation (Anderson, 1983). As a regional community, Hong Kong’s cultural identity similarly requires the medium of popular culture, such as cinema, for its articulation (Zhan, 2012, p. 22). Comrades: Almost a Love Story (2002)  captures local memories suppressed by mainstream histories, using collective memory to fill the void of personal and political identities (Kenry, 1999, p. 421).

From a critical perspective, restorative nostalgia represents not only romantic recollections but also a commodified historical illusion. It signifies an era's inability to confront reality, embodying a collective aphasia of the times. Jameson (1997) regards nostalgia as a cultural feature of postmodernism. In nostalgic consumption, history is suspended, and nostalgia in films establishes an intertextual relationship with the past:
<div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
This ‘textuality’ […] is precisely the most telling symptom of the waning of historicity in our time. […] The new aesthetic mode, with all its internal contradictions, reflects the immense contradictions of our present historical condition. The deepening of aesthetic contradictions signifies our growing inability to reflect and represent our concrete experiences of the present era through cultural forms. (Jameson, 1997, pp. 456, 462)
</div>
In this context, nostalgic films like Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) do not engage with history as a lived reality but rather as a fragmented and aestheticized memory that caters to the audience’s emotional needs. Li and Wang (1998), in their discussion of Hong Kong films Peking Opera Blues (1986) and Rouge (1988), criticized that:
<div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
Nostalgic films attempt to reconstruct a specific cultural experience of a period rather than return to a specific historical context. Nostalgia is not genuinely interested in the past; instead, it seeks to simulate and express a certain mindset of modern individuals, using nostalgia as a means to satisfy this mindset. (Li and Wang, 1998, p. 37)
</div>
In the postmodern condition, characterized by a lack of temporal and spatial depth and a flattened sense of reality, nostalgic imagery is merely a series of consumer products synthesized through music, fashion, hairstyles, and vehicle designs. These images serve to supply a historically detached audience with consumable representations of history. The nostalgic narrative of Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) centers on emotions, simplifying and idealizing the past to provide temporary solace rather than addressing the identity crisis at its core. This highlights the limitation of restorative nostalgia: although its utopian narrative alleviates social anxiety, it may obscure critical reflections on historical complexity, thereby becoming an obstacle to progress.


**3.Reflective Nostalgia in _Made in Hong Kong_ (1997)**
The subject matter of reflective nostalgia does not glorify the historic past but instead emphasizes individual resonances of the past and the process of its passing: “reflective nostalgia is concerned with historical and individual time, with the irrevocability of the past and human finitude” (Boym, 2007, p. 15). Unlike Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996), which seeks to reconstruct a lost home, Chan’s film Made in Hong Kong (1997) centers on the perspectives of marginalized youth and urban peripheral spaces, offering a critical and satirical exploration of an alternative form of nostalgia.

Turner (1987) identifies four major dimensions of the nostalgic paradigm: a sense of historical decline and loss, the absence or erosion of personal wholeness and moral certainty, the loss of individual freedom and autonomy, and the disappearance of genuine social relationships. Made in Hong Kong (1997) reflects these dimensions as they manifest in the societal conditions of Hong Kong on the eve of the Handover. For instance, Moon roams the streets, Ping battles a terminal illness, Lung suffers bullying due to a cognitive disability, and Susan spirals into despair following emotional setbacks. These characters’ struggles illuminate the harsh realities faced by the underprivileged in Hong Kong society.

Details in the film, such as the dialogue between Siu-Wing and his younger cohort—“Why did you change your pager number?” “Boss, I changed it to ‘Celebrate 97 Together.’ What do you think?” “Celebrate my ass!”—highlight its satirical tone (Made in Hong Kong, 1997, 41: 46). In the film’s final scene, Lung is beaten to death by gangsters on the street, and Moon dies beside Ping’s tombstone. All four young protagonists ultimately meet tragic ends, while the sharp female voice on Hong Kong's RTHK broadcasts Mao Zedong’s words to young representatives: “The world belongs to you; you are like the sun at eight or nine in the morning” (01:47:45). These moments, dripping with irony, serve as a haunting prophecy for the Handover of Hong Kong. Reflective nostalgia acknowledges the irreversibility of time—the past cannot be reclaimed. Time flows like Heraclitus' hopeless river, rendering any revival inevitably destined to fail. In addition, idealized moments are absent in reflective nostalgia, which instead blends longing with irony and humor. The movie acknowledges the selective and transformative mechanisms of memory, including collective memory, and maintains a skeptical stance toward the images of the past it produces.

The nostalgic narrative in Made in Hong Kong (1997) can be seen as a counter-discourse to the official historiography of Hong Kong. According to the dominant nationalist narrative, Hong Kong’s handover to mainland China is framed as a homecoming and a linear historical progression, marking both the end of colonialism in China and the beginning of a bright future (Wong, 2000). However, by showcasing marginalized and transient spaces, the film offers a historical perspective that challenges grand narratives. If Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) embodies a utopia, Made in Hong Kong (1997) exemplifies the concept of heterotopia: “Heterotopias are worlds within worlds, mirroring and yet upsetting what is outside” (Foucault, 1967).

The film focuses on peripheral spaces, such as public housing estates and cemeteries. Public housing showcases the dual constraints of material hardship and psychological oppression, serving as the primary stage for the struggles of the underprivileged. Meanwhile, cemeteries symbolize the end of life and the collapse of hope, creating a stark and ironic contrast with the dazzling prosperity of Victoria Harbour. Marginalized histories are recentralized within these peripheral heterotopias, with the film’s red, blue, and green visual style further highlighting the plight of the lower classes and symbolizing the neglect of Hong Kong’s identity by mainstream society. In the film, Moon and Ping grow up under these conditions (Made in Hong Kong, 1997). The oppressive and confining atmosphere of the public housing estates serves as a stark contrast to their internal struggles and feelings of helplessness. These spaces become the stage for their wavering, resistance, and eventual descent into despair. Ultimately, within their brief lifetimes, they are unable to escape from these confines alive.

In 2017, Hong Kong's RTHK ceased broadcasting the BBC World Service after 39 years and began relaying the China National Radio in September (Scott, 2017). The end of the colonial era did not provide Hong Kong with a clear future, while the "one country, two systems" framework introduced further uncertainties. Unlike restorative nostalgia’s obsession with an idealized past, reflective nostalgia reveals the contradictions of modern society and encourages viewers to confront the complexities of identity. The ending of the film suggests that Hong Kong’s future depends on whether its youth can rise above their struggles—accepting death equates to hopelessness, while only a bold and vigorous resurgence can lead to renewal.


**4.Nostalgia’s Dual Role: Solace and Reflection**
Nostalgia, as a symptom of our age (Boym, 2007, p. 8), are side effects of the teleology of progress (p. 10). It not only reflects the dynamic nature of collective memory but also illustrates the contradictions inherent in modernity. Our memories of our common past, and everything we want from it, depend primarily on our present values and goals, not on the past. In this sense, “nostalgia may be an attempt to find some higher meaning in our existenc” (Wilson, 2005, p. 26), becoming an important means and mechanism for dealing with the past in a creative way with the future. 

The nostalgic paradigm of Hong Kong cinema highlights the political issue of the 1997 Handover. It evokes a sense of historical decline and the loss of a golden past while also introducing cultural and identity crises in the present and future. This yearning for the past indicates a detachment from the linear progression of historical time. In the political context, the topic of 1997 emerged abruptly in the mid-1980s, becoming a temporal rupture in how Hong Kong people perceived the future.

However, their nostalgia is not for the hardships of life in the 1950s and 1960s but rather for personal freedom and autonomy. As a counter-memory to official history, nostalgic films rewrite Hong Kong's history through the medium of popular culture. In other words, popular media, particularly cinema, captures the lived experiences of local history are reflected in popular culture and mass media, rather than in the textbooks crafted by colonial education departments or the grand narratives of national history written by mainland Chinese scholars.

As a defining feature of our culture, it is crucial to distinguish and analyze its forms. Nostalgia, described as “the bittersweet recall of emotional past events” (Mills & Coleman, p. 205), is a central theme in both films. It reflects both a longing for the past and an exploration of contemporary identity. In Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996), nostalgia is conveyed through a decade-spanning narrative and cultural symbols, with Li Xiao-Jun’s remark, "We can never go back," symbolizing a farewell to Hong Kong's economic boom and cultural golden age (Comrades: Almost a Love Story, 1996, ). In contrast, Made in Hong Kong (1997) depicts the struggles of marginalized youth, using reflective nostalgia to question the loss of history and the uncertainties of the future.

The differences in nostalgia between the two films can be analyzed through Davis ’s theory of levels of nostalgia (1979). The nostalgia in Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) leans towards the “simple,” as it “harbors the largely unexamined belief that things were better and more beautiful then than now” (Davis, 1979, p. 18). This form of nostalgia reconstructs an idealized utopia through the recreation of symbolic elements from the past, offering solace amidst societal change. However, this restorative nostalgia “tends to confuse the actual home and the imaginary one” (Boym, 2001, p. xvi), failing to critically examine the constructed nature of the past and instead providing emotional comfort in “an unreflective manner” (p. 16).

In contrast, Made in Hong Kong (1997) transcends the idealized construction of past happiness, entering the realm of "reflexive and interpreted" nostalgia. Film critic Lang (2003) describes the Handover of Hong Kong as a "psychological threshold," where reflective "amnesia" symbolizes hope, while restorative "terminal illness" represents pessimism . As Hutcheon (2000) states, our contemporary culture is indeed nostalgic; parts of it—the postmodern parts—are aware of the risks and seductions of nostalgia and attempt to expose those risks through irony. Reflective nostalgia acknowledges the irreversibility of time—the past cannot be retrieved. Time, like an inexorable Heraclitean stream, renders any revival inevitably doomed to failure. The film questions the “authenticity, accuracy, and completeness” of nostalgic claims (Davis, 1979, p. 24), highlighting the contradictions of individuals seeking belonging through nostalgia but encountering the harsh realities of their circumstances.

Although the two forms of nostalgia differ, they are not mutually exclusive, just as emotional memory does not preclude sympathy, judgment, or critical reflection. Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996)  reconstructs collective memory to provide temporary solace but overlooks the complexities and ambiguities of history (Jameson, 1991). In contrast, Made in Hong Kong (1997) refrains from romanticizing the past but employs reflective nostalgia through critique and deconstruction to emphasize the roots of identity crises and social inequalities, inviting viewers to reexamine the connections between history and reality. As Boym (2001) states:
<div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
While restorative nostalgia returns and rebuilds one’s homeland with paranoid determination, reflective nostalgia fears return with the same passion. Home, after all, is not a gated community. Paradise on earth might turn out to be another Potemkin village with no exit. The imperative of a contemporary nostalgic: to be homesick and to be sick of being at home—occasionally at the same time. (Boym, 2001, p. 41)
</div>
In their respective contexts, these two forms of nostalgia give a "voice" to the suppressed subjectivity in the historical narratives of Hong Kong, awakening a sense of social belonging and a pursuit of cultural identity.


**5.Conclusion**
Nostalgia has been regarded as a “cushion” (Godbole et al. 2006, p. 630), offering a self-protection mechanism against death-related concerns (Routledge et al. 2008, p. 137). During times when “societies are in turmoil … experiencing troubles, turbulence, and transformation” (Brown 1999, p. 368), nostalgic sentiments become particularly strong. In the present era, the discourses of nationalism and globalization exert significant influence worldwide: the former seeks to construct a singular historical narrative, while the latter often erases historical traces (Lei, 2021). In the context of pre-Handover Hong Kong, as demonstrated in the discussion, nostalgic films selectively reconstruct images of the past to meet contemporary needs and challenge dominant ideologies. As Hutton (1993) states: 
<div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">
[...] Recollection concerns our present efforts to evoke the past. It is the moment of memory with which we consciously reconstruct images of the past in the selective way that suits the needs of our present situation. (Hutton, 1993, p. xxi)
</div>
It is part of the process of constructing identity (Woodward 1997, p. 11.). History is a product of human memory, which is expressed through the mental activity of repetition and recollection in written form. Nostalgic films accomplish this as a form of memory art. The discussion argues that nostalgic films function not only as artistic expressions of memory but also as psychological processes that reconstruct the past from the perspective of the present through temporal and spatial displacements. This process also facilitates the reconstruction of identity. In the social context of Hong Kong, nostalgic films such as Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) selectively reconstruct the past to address the anxieties surrounding Hong Kong’s identity during the transition period.

Through a comparison of Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) and Made in Hong Kong (1997), the discussion highlights two distinct types of nostalgic narratives and their social significance. The restorative nostalgia in Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) provides emotional solace through its idealized narrative of home. By centering on the collective memory of Hong Kong’s economic prosperity and cultural flourishing during the 1980s, it satisfies viewers’ yearning for stability. However, this form of nostalgia simplifies history into idealized memory, evading deeper societal issues. In contrast, the reflective nostalgia in Made in Hong Kong (1997) highlights the struggles of marginalized youth, exposing identity crises and the contradictions of modernity. It not only questions the authenticity of collective memory but also reconstructs history through temporal and spatial displacements, prompting critical reflection from audiences.

The significance of the discussion lies in demonstrating that nostalgic films during the transitional period of Hong Kong’s history are not merely historical representations but serve dual functions: as emotional comfort and cultural resistance. Although Chan Koon-chung (2010) described the Handover of Hong Kong as an event where “nothing ultimately happened,” nostalgic films in this context provided emotional comfort and intellectual inspiration during a period of transition. Whether through the romanticized storytelling of Comrades: Almost a Love Story (1996) or the critical expressions in Made in Hong Kong (1997), these films demonstrate the multifaceted role of nostalgia in addressing the crises of modernity. Amid the power transition between Britain and China and heightened societal anxiety, nostalgic cinema serves not only as an emotional buffer but also as a form of cultural resistance against dominant narratives.
