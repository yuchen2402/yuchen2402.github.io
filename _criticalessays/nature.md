title: "Biological Nature, Social Division of Labor, and Social Change"
excerpt: "The essay argues that while Feuerbach viewed social division as determined by fixed human biology and Marx attributed it to changing modes of production, a more nuanced perspective sees biology and society as dynamically interacting forces that co-evolve to shape labor, culture, and social transformation."

The origin of the social division of labor has long been a central topic in philosophy, sociology, and economics. Feuerbach argued that human biological nature is constant, and it is precisely this unchanging biological foundation that gives rise to different forms of social division. In his framework, human physiological needs—such as food, safety, and reproduction—necessitate cooperation, while biological differences in strength, endurance, and cognitive ability lead to differentiated roles. Thus, for Feuerbach, social relations are essentially reflections of biological characteristics; human connections and divisions of labor are determined by the innate properties of human nature (Feuerbach, 1841/1989).

Marx revised Feuerbach’s materialism, arguing that it was not biological nature but the relations of production that determine social division. He criticized Feuerbach for being overly static and for ignoring historical transformation. According to Marx, social division is not fixed by biology but shaped by modes of production and relations of production. In other words, human relationships are not governed simply by instinct but by the material and economic foundations of society—its productive forces and social relations (Marx & Engels, 1846/1970).

Traditional philosophy and social theory often treat biological nature as stable and immutable. However, research in modern biology and sociology suggests that biology itself is dynamic and adaptable to environmental changes. If we understand biology as fluid and complex, it may influence social division in more nuanced ways. Feuerbach would explain early human labor differentiation through physical and sensory variation—stronger individuals hunted while those with sharper perception gathered. Marx, however, would interpret the same process as a reflection of economic organization. In feudal society, land ownership structured relations between lords and peasants; in capitalist society, private property creates the employer–worker relationship. These shifts occur not because biology changes, but because modes of production evolve.

Biological nature not only shapes social division but can also be reshaped by it. In today’s digital economy, work increasingly requires computational and information-processing skills. Over time, this environment may subtly reconfigure patterns of cognition and even neural structures. Culture plays a decisive role in reinforcing or diminishing certain biological tendencies. For instance, women were once thought to be less capable in mathematics and science, but as social norms changed, more women entered STEM fields and demonstrated comparable ability. This indicates that biology is not the ultimate determinant of social division; it is influenced by cultural and social contexts.

Historical materialism posits that modes of production are the driving forces of social change, and that the economic base determines the superstructure (Marx, 1859/1971). Yet, if we acknowledge that biology itself is mutable and interacts with its environment, we might expand Marx’s view. Biological nature is not deterministic but provides the potential for social differentiation. Marx emphasized that production shapes division of labor, but biology may influence which capacities are foregrounded in each historical phase. For example, agrarian societies privilege physical labor, while information societies value cognitive skills.

Social relations shape not only thought but also biological expression. When societies encourage the cultivation of certain abilities—such as mathematical or artistic skill—these capacities can manifest biologically. Studies show that learning to read or play an instrument alters brain structure, demonstrating how social environments affect physiology (Doidge, 2007). The interaction between biology and society drives change. While Marx identified class struggle and productive development as the engines of transformation, biological evolution might also shape the trajectory of change. For instance, technological advancement and virtual interaction could gradually alter patterns of thinking, potentially transforming future social structures.

Feuerbach regarded biological nature as fixed and determining social division, while Marx argued that division is defined by social and economic relations rather than biology. Marx expanded Feuerbach’s materialism by adding a historical dimension, emphasizing that social change arises from the contradictions between productive forces and relations of production, not from static biological traits. Biological nature offers possibilities, but social context determines the specific form of division. In this view, biology and society interact dynamically. Social transformation depends not only on economic forces but may also be influenced by biological adaptation. Biology is not the sole determinant of social relations, yet it can shape the direction and pattern of labor division in concert with culture. This perspective diverges from Feuerbach’s “static biological determinism” and Marx’s “social determinism,” proposing instead a dynamic interplay between the two. Such an approach offers a more flexible framework for understanding social division, cultural evolution, and the possibilities of future social development.
