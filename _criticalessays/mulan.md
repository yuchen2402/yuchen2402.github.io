Hua Mulan and Pope Joan are two legendary figures who have inspired generations, though they come from vastly different cultural and historical backgrounds. Mulan originates from ancient Chinese folklore, while Pope Joan’s story emerged from the medieval Christian imagination. In the tale of Mulan, a young woman disguises herself as a man to take her father’s place in the army. After achieving remarkable military success, she refuses official honors and returns quietly to her village, resuming her life as a woman. Pope Joan’s story, told most famously by Emmanuel Rhoides in his novel The Papess Joanna (I Papissa Ioanna), recounts a woman who disguises herself as a man, rises through the ecclesiastical hierarchy, becomes pope, and secretly takes a lover. When she gives birth in public during a procession, her identity is exposed, and she is executed by burning at the stake (Rhoides, 1866/1998).

Both narratives suggest that women possess intelligence and capability equal to men, yet they must conceal their gender to access recognition and authority. However, the tone and cultural implications of the two stories differ sharply. Mulan’s tale, shaped by Confucian values, presents her as a model of filial devotion and national loyalty, while Pope Joan’s story delivers biting satire of the religious and patriarchal institutions that punished female ambition. Joan’s tragic exposure and death lay bare the violent consequences of a system that condemns women not for moral failure but for existing outside prescribed gender boundaries.

Mulan’s story, though often celebrated as empowering in Chinese education, reveals a subtler form of oppression. Her supposed “heroism” is grounded not in individual freedom but in submission to patriarchal duty. She does not freely choose whether to serve; her enlistment is framed as an unquestionable obligation to family and nation. In this sense, the tale embeds a deep contradiction: it praises a woman for transcending gender limitations only by conforming to a masculine model of virtue. As many students grow up admiring Mulan, they internalize an implicit message of “toxic pride”—a satisfaction derived from conforming to patriarchal norms rather than challenging them. This pride, taught through cultural storytelling, celebrates the woman who succeeds not by dismantling the system but by becoming its most loyal participant.

Mulan’s transformation into a “qualified man” secures her honor but not agency. Her achievements are absorbed by the collective—her family, her emperor, her nation—while her personal value remains unfulfilled. Pope Joan, by contrast, exposes the system’s hypocrisy directly. Her punishment is brutal, yet it highlights a truth Mulan’s legend conceals: in patriarchal societies, female excellence is tolerated only when it serves male-defined structures, and any deviation from that service invites annihilation.

Both figures illuminate the complex relationship between gender, recognition, and selfhood. Mulan’s quiet return and Joan’s public death represent two ends of the same spectrum: women who achieve greatness only by suppressing or disguising their femininity. What education and culture have long labeled “female pride” may, in fact, be a refined form of submission—a toxic internalization of patriarchal validation disguised as empowerment.
