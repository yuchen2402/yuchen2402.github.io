title: "The Seven Deadly Sins and Mental Illness: The World’s Greedy Operation and the Individual’s Redemption"
excerpt: "The essay argues that modern mental illness can be understood as a symptom of resistance to a greed-driven world order, where therapeutic “recovery” merely reintegrates individuals into the same moral and economic system built upon the Seven Deadly Sins."

The concept of the Seven Deadly Sins originates from Christian theology. It was first proposed by the monk Evagrius Ponticus in the fourth century and later formalized into its canonical form by Pope Gregory I in the sixth century. The seven sins are Pride, Envy, Gluttony, Lust, Wrath, Greed, and Sloth. Traditionally, these were understood as moral failings that distance humanity from virtue and divine grace. Yet if we move beyond the moral framework of religion, it becomes clear that these “sins” are not confined to theology. They permeate everyday life, shaping our desires, thoughts, and behaviors. In reality, people commit one or more of these sins almost constantly. For instance, when someone feels content and stops striving after comfort, they might be embodying Sloth; when someone asserts their opinion at a meeting convinced that their logic is superior, this reflects Pride; when someone indulges in sensual pleasure or fleeting gratification, they enact Lust or Gluttony.

If the Seven Deadly Sins represent individual psychological and behavioral tendencies, then on a larger scale, the entire world seems to function as a grand manifestation of Greed. Spinoza argued that every entity acts according to its inherent drive and that the world follows an internal logic of necessity rather than chaos (Spinoza, 1677/2002). Hegel similarly viewed history as a rational process governed by teleology, where every stage of human civilization contributes to a greater whole (Hegel, 1837/1956). Indeed, nearly all human activity—from personal career ambition to corporate expansion to national economic growth—operates according to purposive desire. In this sense, purpose itself is simply a refined expression of Greed: the endless urge to acquire, expand, and dominate.

Within this framework, mental illness can be interpreted as a symptom of resistance or maladaptation to this world’s greedy logic. If the modern world runs on the fuel of Greed, then mental disorders may represent the friction between human psychology and the economic–cultural demand for constant productivity. Depression, for example, may be understood as the tension between Sloth and Greed: the refusal or inability to compete, coupled with an internalized awareness of society’s expectations. Anxiety might reflect the clash between Greed and Envy—the relentless desire for success paired with the terror of failure or being surpassed. Disorders such as binge eating or addiction combine Gluttony and Sloth, seeking immediate satisfaction while spiraling into guilt and disgust. In this view, mental illness is not an isolated individual problem but the psychological residue of the world’s moral contradictions, where sin becomes systematized.

We might even ask whether modern psychiatry’s therapeutic interventions are, in fact, designed to reintegrate individuals back into this system of Greed. When a depressed person regains motivation through treatment and reenters the workforce, they are not merely “cured” but are reinvested into the productive machinery of society. When an anxious person learns to manage their fear of failure through cognitive therapy, they are being trained to function more efficiently within a competitive order. From this perspective, mental illness is not an aberration that the world cannot tolerate but a necessary variable that the system continually regulates to sustain its own motion. Those who fail to serve the logic of Greed are pathologized, while medicine, psychology, and social norms work together to reshape them into compliant agents of productivity.

The goal here is not to moralize. If everyone commits one or more of the Seven Sins, then guilt becomes universal and meaningless. Instead, the world itself can be seen as engaged in a perpetual process of atonement—a cycle of sin, desire, and re-sin. Mental illness, in this light, is not an exception but a manifestation of this cycle. Modern society’s attempt to “cure” it is less about healing and more about restoring individuals to the system’s dominant logic. At its core, that logic remains Greed.

In other words, the world keeps turning, and we keep atoning. Mental illness may simply be one fragment of this vast mechanism, reminding us that no one can truly transcend the Seven Sins. Every act of recovery or adaptation is, perhaps, just another way of committing sin anew.
