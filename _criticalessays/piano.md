title: "Echoes of a Lost Time: Nostalgia and Melancholia in The Deserted Village and Eton College"
excerpt: "This essay examines The Deserted Village and Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College through the lens of nostalgic melancholia, exploring how both poems dramatize the temporal tension between memory and loss. It argues that Goldsmith’s restorative nostalgia aspires to rebuild a vanished moral order, whereas Gray’s reflective nostalgia accepts irretrievability and turns remembrance into introspection. Together they illuminate the eighteenth century’s poetic negotiation between time, emotion, and historical consciousness.

### Echoes of a Lost Time
This essay examines *The Deserted Village* and *Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College* through the lens of nostalgic melancholia, exploring how both poems dramatize the temporal tension between memory and loss.

It argues that Goldsmith’s restorative nostalgia aspires to rebuild a vanished moral order, whereas Gray’s reflective nostalgia accepts irretrievability and turns remembrance into introspection. Together they illuminate the eighteenth century’s poetic negotiation between time, emotion, and historical consciousness.
