title: "Echoes of a Lost Time: Nostalgia and Melancholia in _The Deserted Village_ and _Eton College_"
excerpt: "Abstract: This essay examines _The Deserted Village_ and _Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College_ through the lens of nostalgic melancholia, exploring how both poems dramatize the temporal tension between memory and loss. It argues that Goldsmith’s restorative nostalgia aspires to rebuild a vanished moral order, whereas Gray’s reflective nostalgia accepts irretrievability and turns remembrance into introspection. Together they illuminate the eighteenth century’s poetic negotiation between time, emotion, and historical consciousness.(MA coursework essay, _Melancholia and Hypochondria in 18th Century Europe_, King’s College London.)"
