title: "The Rift Between Poetry and the Novel: Language and the Symbolic Order in a Depressive Context through Kristeva’s Theory"
excerpt: "The essay argues that, in Kristeva’s theory, poetry’s fluid and deconstructive language opens a path for transforming loss and depression, whereas the novel’s rigid symbolic unity reinforces emotional stagnation and the illusion of wholeness."

Julia Kristeva sees poetry not merely as a vehicle for conveying meaning but as a practice—one capable of both deconstructing and reconstructing the symbolic order. As noted in Ethics, Politics, and Difference in Julia Kristeva’s Writing, “poetic language explicitly intervenes in the deconstruction and reconstruction of the boundaries of the symbolic… poetry reveals the very process by which meaning itself comes into being” (p. 3). Kristeva further emphasizes that, through its inherent indeterminacy and rhythmic force, poetry places the subject in a “state of experimentation.” This disrupts fixed notions of unified selfhood and opens a space where loss—especially maternal loss—can be both denied and reborn. Such openness and multiplicity, she argues, are crucial ways to resist the exhaustion of meaning and the paralysis of affect (Kristeva, 1993, p. 3).

In contrast, Kristeva’s critique of the nineteenth-century novel is far sharper. She points out that the novel often “embodies and safeguards a false sense of unity,” trapping the subject within a fixed, closed symbolic system that excludes any genuine encounter with the “Other,” particularly the internal difference of the maternal. As she writes, “This mode of writing [the novel] not only maintains the illusion of stability within the symbolic order, but also binds the subject to an immutable cultural unity” (p. 42). Within the context of depression, such rigidity in language and form can prevent the necessary transformation of loss and mourning, thereby intensifying meaninglessness and emotional numbness (Kristeva, 1993, p. 42).

Taken together, Kristeva’s reflections on these two literary forms reveal two opposing linguistic paths. Poetry, with its fluidity and multiplicity, seeks to deconstruct and regenerate. Poetic language transforms the “symbolic rupture”—the gap created by the loss of the maternal signifier in depression—into an open, generative mode of expression, offering what Kristeva calls a “second nature” for the restoration of meaning.

The novel, on the other hand, tends to reproduce and reinforce the existing symbolic order, sustaining a false sense of cultural coherence. This rigidity constrains the articulation of deep loss and psychic trauma, potentially trapping the subject in depression—unable to reimagine or translate the Other.

As Kristeva’s theoretical work suggests, the deconstructive quality of language—as exemplified by poetry—may offer a pathway out of fixed identity and emotional stagnation. Conversely, narratives that cling too tightly to symbolic unity, such as the traditional realist novel, may amplify the subject’s inner loss and repression. This contrast not only exposes the differing ways genres engage with themes of maternity, loss, and identity, but also deepens our understanding of how language and the symbolic order interact within the depressive condition.
