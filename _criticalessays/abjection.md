title: "Depression Therapy through Kristeva’s Theory of Abjection — The Phenomenon of Disgust in _Anton Reiser_"
excerpt: "The essay argues that, in Kristeva’s theory, poetry’s fluid and deconstructive language opens a path for transforming loss and depression, whereas the novel’s rigid symbolic unity reinforces emotional stagnation and the illusion of wholeness."

Let’s start with the conclusion: confronting terrifying images—corpses, blood, or storms—can evoke a strange, almost masochistic pleasure. Such encounters expose the subject to what Julia Kristeva calls the Real, a space of deep inner contradiction that lies beyond language and symbolic order. In doing so, they may open the possibility—though not without risk—of reentering symbolic structure and alleviating depressive symptoms.
(That said, it’s dangerous. Don’t try this at home.)

Julia Kristeva, in Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection (1982), explores the notion of abjection—the affective response a subject experiences when confronted with the fragile boundary between life and death, purity and filth. Through abjection, one brushes up against the Real in the Lacanian sense: that which eludes signification. The subject is simultaneously repelled and drawn in, torn between fascination and disgust.

In Karl Philipp Moritz’s novel Anton Reiser, the protagonist Anton witnesses a public execution where four criminals are beheaded. From a Kristevan perspective, Anton’s experience of disgust reveals his inner anxiety and fractured sense of identity. His revulsion is not merely toward the external world but toward his own repressed conflicts and desires.

Excerpt from the novel:

“He followed the crowd to the execution ground in Hanover, where four criminals were to be beheaded. Amid the throng, the condemned appeared small, less significant than a tree in the forest or an ox in the slaughterhouse. Watching their limbs cut off and their bodies tied to the wheel, Anton thought: ‘To tear a human into pieces is so easy, so meaningless.’ The thought filled him with doubt about the worth of life itself... His mind returned again and again to the image of the scaffold, the falling axe, the lifeless, dismembered bodies.
Everything he saw etched itself into his mind as if death itself had touched him. Over time, he found a somber peace in these thoughts. The horror of execution turned into indifference toward all living things. He began to observe the crowd with increasing detachment, as though he were a stranger among them, a shadow moving across the earth. His longing for death first made him lonely, then became a silent companion—a voice reminding him that everything is transient. The impression of that day opened a door within him, a new way of thinking. Others might forget the execution soon enough, but for him it remained, like a hidden wound.”
(Moritz, 1997, pp. 180–183)

In Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia (1989), Kristeva discusses the crucial role of the “murder of the mother” in the subject’s entry into the symbolic order. Depressed individuals, she argues, fail to complete the work of mourning—especially the separation from the maternal figure—and remain trapped in the inexpressible realm of the Thing (la Chose). Anton’s early trauma, shaped by his mother’s hypersensitivity and volatility, left a deep psychological wound. When he witnesses the Hanover execution, he encounters a form of unspoken emotion—an echo of the “unfinished matricide.” This emotion both torments and attracts him, forcing reflection and ultimately enabling him to reconcile his inner contradictions and reenter the symbolic world governed by reason and structure.

Abjection, therefore, can both destroy and heal. It can dissolve the self or act as a bridge back to symbolic order. In the context of depression therapy, Kristeva’s theory suggests that allowing patients to face and articulate their abjection—rather than repressing it—might help transform raw, inexpressible affect into symbolic language. This process could assist in reintegrating the self and easing depressive symptoms.

Still, the practical application is fraught with ethical and psychological danger: when, where, and how one invites such confrontation—and the degree of horror involved—must be handled with utmost care.
