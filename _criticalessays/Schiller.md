Writing under depression is not necessarily a bad idea. Depression is a complex, multilayered emotional experience that can involve anxiety, agitation, lethargy, and grief in fluctuating cycles. Authors who write during depressive states often capture these emotional shifts within their texts, allowing readers to feel the rise and fall of melancholia more vividly rather than through detached abstraction.

Schiller emphasized the idea of writing “from gentle remembrance,” suggesting that “a poet may create from tender recollection, but must never write when ruled by passion. Ideal beauty can only be born from the freedom of the mind; only by transcending emotion can one shape the highest form of beauty” (Schiller, 1795/1967). This method, while more rational and disciplined, risks losing the immediacy and vitality of lived emotion. It becomes the perspective of an observer rather than a participant in melancholy.

In contrast, Keats in Ode on Melancholy (1819) writes directly from within the emotional surge of sorrow: “But when the melancholy fit shall fall / Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud.” Rather than waiting for calm reflection as Schiller advised, Keats embraces the peak of feeling. This momentary eruption makes melancholy immediate and sensorial, allowing readers to inhabit the emotional landscape of depression as it unfolds (Keats, 1819/2001).

Friedrich Hölderlin, on the other hand, achieves a gentler tone in Hälfte des Lebens (Half of Life, 1804). The first half of the poem is filled with idyllic imagery—“yellow pears hanging, full of wild roses”—symbolizing fullness and vitality. The second half turns to a reflective sadness: “Where shall I find, when it is winter, the flowers?” (Hölderlin, 1804/1990). His melancholy is not the fiery outpouring of Byron or Keats, but a distant contemplation. The poem’s structure itself mirrors the rhythm of life: flourishing and decay, fullness and loss, rather than emotional collapse.

Neither approach is inherently superior. They simply illustrate two aesthetic temperaments. One is immediate and immersive, charged with emotional intensity as in the works of Keats and Byron. The other is tempered and introspective, characterized by tender recollection and emotional distance, as in Hölderlin and Gray. Both can express melancholy profoundly, but through different pathways—one by plunging into emotion, the other by remembering it.
