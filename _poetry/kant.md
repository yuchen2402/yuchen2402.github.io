**1**

Consen and Reitan were travelers from different lands. They had never met before, yet on a mountain path their journeys crossed by chance. Suddenly, both slipped into a deep and shadowy cavern. The cave was rich in water and food, but a strange voice from the darkness told them that they could leave only if they reached an agreement about the true knowledge of the apple tree that grew outside the cave. Their conclusion must be written down and pushed through a small hole in the wall to the mysterious power beyond. Only if that unseen judge approved their answer would they ever see daylight again.

Consen, who called himself a pure empiricist, insisted that all knowledge came from direct experience. Reitan, who prided himself on being a pure rationalist, believed that true knowledge must arise from reason alone. They could not agree on how the apple tree should be known.

Consen scratched his head and spoke first.
“We must step outside,” he said, “and observe the apple tree with our own senses. We need to see its shape and color, smell its fragrance, touch its bark, even taste its fruit. Only then can we know what it truly is. Knowledge and truth can be gained only through the senses.”

Reitan said nothing. The corner of his mouth twitched, somewhere between a polite smile and the involuntary movement of disdain. It was impossible to tell whether he was mocking Consen or approving him. Without replying, he set down his backpack, unscrewed a bottle of water, and began to drink.

Seeing that Reitan remained silent, Consen shrugged and walked toward the faint light. The apple tree stood right at the mouth of the cave, beyond which thick fog spread in all directions. He gazed at it closely. His eyes caught a hint of red; his nose recognized the scent of fruit; his fingers felt the roughness of bark. Satisfied, he returned to the cave and said eagerly to Reitan,
“It’s simple. The apples are red, the bark is coarse, and the air smells sweet. All we have to do is send these observations through the hole, and we can go home!”

“Absurd!” Reitan stretched his arms and let out a lazy yawn, rolling his eyes as the quiet arrogance of a self-proclaimed rationalist began to show.
“You have gathered nothing but fragments of sensory data. That is completely unreliable! The red you saw through the fog—how can you be sure it was the true color of the apple and not just a reflection from a pane of glass? The rough surface you touched—was that really the bark, or did you simply assume so because past experience taught you what bark should feel like? What if your old experiences do not apply to this tree at all? What if what you touched as bark was actually a leaf? You say you smelled the scent of apples, but what if you have a cold, and what you actually smelled was only the mucus in your own nose? Consen, you foolish empiricist! You have collected a handful of fleeting sensations—redness, roughness, fragrance—but these are mere appearances. They tell you nothing about the true knowledge of the apple tree.”

Reitan paced back and forth before the speechless Consen and went on.
“You say the apple is red, yet under different light its color may change entirely. You say the bark is rough, but what if your fingers were suddenly injured and could no longer feel? Would you still call it rough? Your experiences are unstable, subjective, and momentary. They are far from what can be called true knowledge.”

“Knowledge arises from reason, not from sensory experience,” Reitan said calmly. His eyes no longer met Consen’s. Instead, he reached into his backpack and took out a small, flower-patterned blanket that his grandmother had knitted for him long ago. He spread it neatly on the ground, sat cross-legged against the cave wall, and closed his eyes in quiet meditation.

“To understand the apple tree,” he continued, “one needs only rational deduction. From the principles of biology, we know that a tree is a kind of plant, and every plant must have roots, stems, and leaves. Therefore, the apple tree must possess these as well. The apple, being a fruit, must conform to the rules of geometry; it should be spherical or nearly spherical. As for its color, that is merely an attribute bestowed by our minds. It depends on our perception, not on any external experience.”

Consen frowned, irritated by the man’s arrogance. This was the very image of a proud rationalist. He waved his broad hand before Reitan’s face and snapped, “You are merely daydreaming in the dark! Your reasoning may sound logical, but how can you be sure that the apple tree in reality fits your imagined structure?”

Reitan opened his eyes slowly, shaking his head as if brushing away a child’s hand. Seizing the moment, Consen pressed on, his voice growing urgent.

“Listen to me, Reitan. My senses may be limited by circumstance, but the information they bring is not empty conjecture. Through direct observation I can perceive the red of the fruit, the roughness of the bark, and the sweet fragrance in the air. These are concrete, verifiable facts. I plan to design a series of experiments, to record these observations, and to prove them with objective data. These data are the true foundation of knowledge. Reitan, you must see that your rationalist system has gone astray. Do you really believe that by sitting still and thinking alone, you can know everything there is to know? Stand up. Come with me. Let us experiment together.”

Reitan slowly shook his head, his voice calm yet firm.

“Consen, you believe that your experimental data capture the inherent properties of the apple tree. In truth, they are nothing more than fleeting impressions—momentary perceptions you happened to gather during your brief contact with it. The true concept of the apple tree does not depend on these fragmented sensations, but on the universal truths revealed through rational deduction. From the fundamental principles of biology and geometry, we can conclude that an apple tree must have roots, a trunk, and leaves, and its fruit must follow geometric regularity, being spherical or nearly spherical. Such necessity transcends all individual variations.”

Consen scoffed, replying with visible disdain.

“Your reasoning may be rigorous, but it is built on nothing more than abstract models. The ‘necessities’ you imagine—how can you be certain they apply to this real apple tree in front of us? My sensory experiments, though bound by time and place, deal directly with the thing itself. Your so-called universal principles can only tell you what an *ideal* apple tree should be, not what *this* one truly is in all its concrete detail.”

Reitan walked to the center of the cave, his steps measured and his gaze sweeping across the dim stone walls.

“Precisely because sensory information is subjective and ever-changing, we must rely on reason,” he said evenly. “Your experiments may capture phenomena at a given moment, but they cannot yield a complete understanding of the apple tree’s essence. Reason alone can organize the fragments of experience and uncover the necessary conditions that lie beyond them. Take the question of existence itself—for example, we can never grasp what ‘to exist’ truly means without rigorous reasoning. The senses only tell us that something *appears* to exist; they never reveal what existence *is*.”

The tension between them grew sharper. Consen raised his voice, unable to contain himself.

“You speak in lofty abstractions and forget the force of reality! Reason that is untested by observation, that refuses experiment, is nothing but a castle in the air. My senses tell me the color, the texture, the fragrance of the apple tree—these are tangible, undeniable. They are the only reliable path toward real knowledge!”

Reitan smiled faintly, his tone unshaken.

“Then tell me, how will you account for the truth hidden beyond the fog? In the darkness and the mist, your senses are prone to endless distortions. Can you be sure that the red you see is not a trick of the light? Can your sense of touch remain accurate if your hand were ever wounded? I, on the other hand, can build a coherent structure of necessity through logic and deduction. Even under the worst of conditions, those rational forms will never be shaken.”

Their debate raged on, shifting from the color of the apples and the texture of the bark to the biological structure and geometric form of the tree itself. Consen, citing his previous observations, argued passionately, “What experience gives me is more than mere impressions—it forms a kind of *factual knowledge*, something no pure deduction could ever replace.”

Reitan replied with equal conviction, “But knowledge gained through reason is universal and necessary. Your data may be distorted by changes in circumstance, yet through rational deduction we can uncover a truth that transcends time and space. No matter how the apple tree may change, its inner structure will always obey immutable laws.”


**2**

The debate led neither man to yield. Consen and Reitan each resolved to stand firm in their convictions. Consen reached for his travel pack, which contained the instruments necessary for scientific investigation. He believed that if he could conduct a thorough empirical examination of the apple tree, its “essence” would inevitably reveal itself. Reitan, by contrast, pulled out his blanket, brushed the dust from the dry cave floor, and sat cross-legged to meditate. From time to time he opened a blank notebook, filling its pages with mathematical formulas and quiet sketches born from contemplation.

Consen took a deep breath of the damp, mist-tinged air outside the cave, then stepped forward with both caution and determination. Approaching the apple tree, he opened his small notebook and took out a pencil. He began carefully recording the tree’s overall form—the outline of its crown, the distribution of its branches—and even made rubbings of the bark’s texture. Next, he produced a portable ruler and a color chart to measure the diameter of the fruit, the saturation of its red hue, and the degree of roughness on the bark.

“This red isn’t a single tone,” he murmured with scientific precision, “it’s mixed with hints of orange and deep crimson. I must note that carefully—only through repeated observation can random error be eliminated.”

Then, from a small pouch, he drew a clean cloth to wipe several sections of the trunk before testing its surface texture by touch. Patiently, he tapped the bark, listening to the faintly muffled echo that told him of the wood’s solidity. To minimize sensory bias, he repeated each measurement at different times of day—morning and afternoon—recording the variations in temperature, light, and humidity that might affect his perception.

Consen declared with confidence, “My experiments are not idle imaginings but repeated, faithfully documented observations. Only through such empirical verification can we truly grasp what makes this apple tree unique.” His tone carried both the certainty of one devoted to data and the thinly veiled contempt of a man weary of abstract talk.

He found a flat patch of ground beside the tree and laid out a sheet of white paper. Taking out his phone, he used the macro lens to capture close-up images of the fruit, recording the fine details of its surface. Recalling Reitan’s earlier criticism—that experimental results could shift with changing conditions—Consen began recording video as well, capturing the apple tree under different lighting to document how its colors transformed through the day.

Throughout the process, he worked methodically, annotating every observation, marking timestamps, and cross-checking results. His notebook filled with neatly written data—measurements, sensory notes, environmental variables—all laid out with precision. Finally, he murmured to himself, half in satisfaction, half in reflection, “The figures vary slightly under different conditions, but in the end, the apple tree consistently presents the same verifiable sensory characteristics.”

With a triumphant smile, Consen strode back into the cave and tossed his notebook onto the ground; it landed with a crisp _snap_. Standing before Reitan—who remained cross-legged in meditation—he spoke with a note of pride:

“Old man, still sitting there meditating? Let me tell you, I’ve unveiled the veil of that apple tree. I’ve uncovered the real, tangible truth!”

Reitan slowly opened his eyes. A trace of disdain glimmered in his sharp gaze, and the corner of his mouth lifted into a faint, knowing smile.

“Oh?” he said lazily. “Then go on—tell me, what exactly is your so-called _tangible truth_?”

“It’s all right here in my notebook,” Consen declared, tapping the cover with conviction. “These pages contain the precise measurements gathered from repeated observation—the verified data on color, texture, shape, and scent. The sum of these sensory details forms the true image of the apple tree. There is no essence beyond direct experience, no hidden or abstract nature that exists apart from what can be observed, touched, or measured. In other words, this apple tree is a natural entity composed entirely of perceptible facts. All knowledge comes from sensory data, and what we call its *essence* is nothing more than the totality of its concrete attributes, not some phantom born of your empty meditations.”

He slapped the notebook open and pointed excitedly to the pages filled with data.
“The apple’s diameter ranges between 7.2 and 7.4 centimeters. Under different lighting, the fruit reflects wavelengths between 650 and 700 nanometers. The texture roughness remains consistently between 120 and 150 micrometers. And the scent’s intensity can be detected at measurable distances by the human nose…”

Reitan listened impassively, his expression unchanging. Then, with a faint smile, he stooped to pick up a smooth pebble from the cave floor and began etching a series of mathematical symbols onto the wall. His writing was swift, assured, and almost graceful. Speaking calmly as he worked, he said,

“Your parameters are amusing, I admit. But now, let me show you my reasoning.”

Consen frowned, watching as symbols and equations began to cover the stone surface.

“According to the golden ratio principle in plant growth,” Reitan explained, “the ratio between the apple’s diameter and its stem width should roughly conform to a fixed proportion. Its spherical structure can be modeled as an ellipsoid, whose volume can be determined by this equation: (…). Here, *a* represents the equatorial radius, and *b* the polar radius of the fruit.”

He continued etching fluently:
“As for color, by applying the mathematical model of light waves, we can calculate the variation in surface reflectivity under different intensities of illumination. And for the fragrance—its diffusion rate can be derived from the molecular motion equation. At a given temperature and pressure, I can determine how far the scent travels. All of this,” he concluded with quiet confidence, “can be deduced through mathematical reasoning, without ever stepping outside to observe the tree.”

Consen stared at the equations on the wall. His expression, once filled with disdain, slowly shifted toward astonishment.

Reitan slowly turned, his sharp gaze locking onto Consen.
“I’m afraid, young man,” he said with calm precision, “that your experimental data happens to coincide almost perfectly with the results I derived through pure mathematics. In other words, I never needed to *see* the apple tree, nor to *smell* its fragrance, nor to *touch* its bark. Simply by sitting here, relying on logic and calculation, I already knew everything about it.”

Consen’s eyes widened. For a moment, he stood speechless, unable to find a retort.

Reitan, clearly savoring the tension, spread his hands and gave a slow, indulgent shrug.
“What you have gathered,” he said, “are fragments of sensory data. What I have obtained is a universal truth that transcends individual appearances. The knowledge of the apple tree I’ve reached through reason is far nobler than yours.”

Consen bit his lip and narrowed his eyes, staring intently at Reitan. Then, suddenly, he burst into laughter.
“Ha! Don’t you see? That means you and I are *the same*! We both believe we’ve uncovered the essence of the apple tree—only you reached it through mathematical deduction, while I reached it through direct sensory experience.”

Reitan frowned. “How could that possibly be *the same*?”

“Think about it,” Consen replied, his voice rising with excitement. “Our conclusions are nearly identical, yet you’ve never seen that tree, while I’ve touched it with my own hands. It means that somehow, our two approaches—observation and reasoning—arrive at the same result. But clearly, the focus of each path is entirely different.”

Reitan fell silent. A flicker of uncertainty crossed his eyes. His habitual disdain for empiricism seemed momentarily shaken by Consen’s laughter.

Consen caught his breath, leaned closer, and tapped lightly on Reitan’s forehead.
“So here’s the real question,” he said with a quiet intensity. “If the essence of the apple tree is truly nothing more than a collection of sensory data, then how did *you* manage to deduce it through pure reasoning? And if its essence really lies in mathematical structure, then how did *I* perceive it through experience? Tell me, Reitan—does experience confirm reason, or does reason verify experience?”

Reitan did not answer right away. His eyes grew distant and thoughtful as he began to reexamine the notes and equations spread before him.
The air between them felt charged, heavy with the sense that something larger—something beyond their argument—was about to be revealed. Though their conclusions seemed to align, the subtle rift between them hinted at a deeper truth waiting to be uncovered.

When they finally handed their combined report to the “mysterious force” through the hole in the cave wall, a long sigh echoed from above. The sound was cold and faintly scornful, as if to say, *“You have not yet reached true understanding.”*

Reitan lifted his head. His gaze shimmered with the steady light of reason, and his tone was calm but resolute.
“Consen, your experimental data may appear solid,” he began, “but you must realize that sensory experience is always bound by circumstance. If the apple tree were to be eaten away by insects or to wither in poor soil, what would your measurements prove then? No matter how many experiments you conduct, you will always gather a series of fragmented and temporary impressions, never the eternal essence of the tree.”

Consen’s face reddened. He slammed his notebook shut and snapped, “Easy for you to say! At least my conclusions are grounded in what I’ve actually seen, touched, and heard. Your so-called ‘mathematical knowledge’ exists only in your head—abstract symbols with no pulse! Or are you simply afraid to test them against reality, because if you did, your entire temple of rationalism might crumble?”

Reitan smiled faintly, shrugging with quiet amusement. “I don’t fear doubt,” he replied evenly. “I only believe that some truths are too fundamental to require it. Look here—by applying biological and geometric principles, I can deduce that an apple tree must possess roots, a trunk, and leaves. This is not just a common pattern but a necessary mathematical law. To question such principles would be to undermine the very structure of knowledge itself.”

Consen spread his hands in exasperation, his voice rising. “And yet you must admit that we all arrive at those so-called ‘laws’ *through experience*! Every observation I’ve made confirms them. Your so-called necessity is just reason flattering itself with tidy abstractions. The apple’s red skin, the rough texture of its bark—these are facts, facts that I’ve confirmed with my own senses! If not for my observations, how could you possibly know that your formulas correspond to any real apple tree at all?”

Reitan paused, his expression softening into contemplation. After a long silence, he replied,
“Your observations are indeed precise, but they only describe how the apple tree *appears* under certain conditions, at certain moments. Change the light, or the state of the tree itself, and your sensory data shifts with it. My deductions, however, rest upon principles that do not change—natural laws and mathematical relations that hold in every circumstance. Such rational knowledge possesses universality and stability, transcending the fleeting subjectivity of your experience.”

The two men stood facing each other for a long time, neither willing to yield. Finally, Consen struck the table with his palm and said coolly,
“It seems we still cannot persuade one another. Your rational deduction and my direct observation both have their flaws. Perhaps this means that the essence of the apple tree cannot be revealed through pure reason or pure experience alone, but through some interaction between the two.”

Reitan remained silent for a while, his expression thoughtful, as though weighing the implication of Consen’s words. Then he spoke slowly,
“Perhaps you are right. Our conclusions match almost perfectly in number, yet our interpretations of what that means differ profoundly. Reason tells me that an apple tree must have roots, a trunk, leaves, and that its fruit must be round. But that describes only its ideal form. Your experience shows me its current appearance, yet it tells us nothing of its enduring nature.”

Their eyes met in the dim light of the cave. For the first time, neither spoke from pride nor certainty. Both realized they had brushed against something deeper—a truth suggesting that only through the fusion of reason and experience could one ever approach the real essence of the apple tree, or of anything at all.


**3**

Reitan said softly, “Consen, I’ve begun to see that pure mathematical reasoning and conceptual deduction cannot truly capture the vivid, living, and ever-changing qualities that your senses perceive in the apple tree. My rational system can describe its geometry with precision—it may tell us that the fruit is roughly spherical, perhaps with a central axis of symmetry—but beyond that, all the life of the tree, its texture and immediacy, vanish into abstraction.”

He opened his eyes slowly; for the first time, there was a trace of uncertainty in them. Consen, expecting another round of disdain for experience, was surprised to hear such honest recognition of reason’s limits.

Consen replied, “I’ve realized something similar. Experiments and observations alone often lead to confusion and uncertainty. I’m always anxious that the external world might change the apple tree itself—light, season, insects, even flaws in my own perception—all these can affect what I conclude. I can’t claim my experiments reveal anything eternal. How can I be sure the apple tree must always have roots and leaves? What if, somewhere else, another kind of ‘apple tree’ grows with an entirely different form? As you said, that might lie beyond the reach of my individual experience.”

He shrugged helplessly. “And what’s more, I rely on induction to arrive at general rules like ‘plants usually have roots, stems, and leaves.’ Isn’t that already using a sort of quasi-rational principle to filter my experience? Can I really separate myself from all prior assumptions?”

Both men fell silent. The dim oil lamp on the stone wall flickered gently, as though hinting that a new idea was forming between them. After a long pause, they spoke again—this time without anger, but with curiosity and calm.

Reitan said, “Perhaps we must admit that real knowledge is neither received passively from the senses nor constructed entirely by cold reasoning in the mind. Both the sensory appearances and the rational forms we impose on them play essential roles. You once challenged me—saying that if I never confirmed my formulas through any sensory contact, my logic would be unanchored from the world. And I challenged you—that if you relied only on fragmented observations, you would never glimpse the deeper conditions beneath them. Maybe both of us were right.”

Consen nodded slowly.
“I’m beginning to understand something,” he said. “To explain why I can look at my experience and say ‘that is an apple tree,’ there must already be some structure of thought—some prior principle—that allows me to gather the colors, shapes, and scents before me and combine them into a single object. Without this inner faculty of synthesis, every perception I record in my experiments would remain a collection of scattered, disconnected fragments.”

He paused and glanced at Reitan.
“So to truly *know* the apple tree, there must be two elements: first, the external sensory impressions themselves; and second, the mind’s forms, rules, or categories that shape and organize those impressions. But what exactly are these ‘categories’? Are they the pure concepts you spoke of earlier? Or could it be that our minds are equipped with built-in structures that weave sensory data into a coherent whole?”

Reitan nodded gravely.
“Exactly. We might suppose that all knowledge of the external world depends on both the stimulation of our senses by things outside us and the pre-existing forms within reason or the mind that process that stimulation. For instance, we inevitably perceive all things within the frameworks of *space* and *time*. We cannot step outside those dimensions. If we wish to know the apple tree, we must first recognize that it appears to us as a tree precisely because our senses distinguish it in space and time, while our mind uses a set of concepts or rules to unify the sensory data. In that sense, the apple tree you perceive is both a product of observation and a result of thought organizing sensory content.”

He raised a hand toward the upper part of the cave, as though pointing to the ghostly outline of the tree beyond.
“Yet we cannot claim that the tree is merely our illusion. It truly exists—but we can only perceive and understand it *in the way our faculties allow*. What it is ‘in itself,’ apart from how it appears to us, we may never know. At least, when we speak of knowledge, all we can discuss is the form in which it presents itself to us, and the way our mental categories shape that presentation.”

Consen murmured thoughtfully,
“It’s as if we can never know the apple tree in its pure state of being—we can only know how it becomes an object of our experience and our thought. So it’s not merely my sensory power, nor your logical faculty, but a deeper system that already determines how we derive structured understanding from sensory input.”

He struck his forehead, suddenly enlightened.
“Perhaps this is the new path we’ve both been seeking. We must accept the driving force of external experience, yet also acknowledge that beyond experience there are *a priori* forms shaping how we organize it. Then the so-called ‘essence’ of the apple tree isn’t simply what the senses expose, nor what pure reason deduces—it depends on how our mind structures outer phenomena through these innate forms.”

Reitan’s eyes widened, and a spark of realization crossed between them.
“Indeed. If we understand these *a priori* structures as the bridge between reason and experience, then empiricists need not fear that their data are scattered or fleeting, and rationalists need not dread sensory uncertainty. Instead, we share a common foundation: the senses provide the material, the *a priori* forms give it unity.”

In the dim cave, their voices softened, gaining depth. The torchlight flickered over their faces, as if revealing the dual nature of the apple tree itself—rooted in the tangible world yet shaped by the innate order of the mind.

And somewhere in the silence, the “mysterious power” seemed to await their final accord. This new understanding allowed them to preserve the concreteness of experience without losing the universality of reason—a reconciliation that had eluded them before. In this synthesis, the true knowledge of the apple tree belonged neither solely to the outer world nor solely to the inner mind, but to the meeting point between the two.

The two men turned toward the faint shadow on the cave wall, as though perceiving something they had both long sought: that the whole secret of the tree might forever dwell in that in-between realm—one that could never be fully captured by pure reason, nor exhausted by pure experience.


**4**

After a long and searching debate, Consen and Reitan finally brought together their observations and rational deductions into a single statement, written on that sheet of paper:

**Transcendental Idealism**
By Immanuel **Kant**

The “essence” of the apple tree is neither merely what the naked eye perceives—the branches, roots, and fruit transmitted through the senses—nor simply an abstract entity derived from the cold deductions of geometry or arithmetic.

What truly constitutes the existence of this apple tree lies in the synthesis between the manifold impressions captured by our senses and the innate forms of space, time, and the categories of reason through which our mind organizes them.

In other words, the truth of the apple tree manifests only within the interplay between the a priori framework of our cognition and the empirical data of experience. Every leaf and branch appears to us in the way it does because it is shaped by those innate forms; and what we know is only this processed appearance—never the thing-in-itself that transcends all phenomena.

Thus we can say: the apple tree, as it exists for us, is a phenomenon—dependent on sensory experience yet formed through the a priori structures of reason. This phenomenon reveals both the concrete richness of the outer world and the universal order imposed by the human mind.

Our ability to discern the common laws of apple trees amid the chaos of experience rests upon a transcendental principle within us, which unites all sensory data into one coherent whole. Yet that which lies beyond both experience and these innate structures—the true “essence” of the tree—must forever remain unknown.

In conclusion, the truth of the apple tree—its mode of existence as it appears within our cognition, formed through the synthesis of sense and reason—is the very heart of what we call Transcendental Idealism.

When they submitted this page, a voice from above finally sighed,
"You have reached consensus—for now."

And so the two stepped out of the deep cavern, into the pale light of dawn.

On that sheet, the name “Kant”—born from the merging of Consen and Reitan—stood not merely as a signature, but as a symbol of their reconciliation: the transcendence of the old opposition between pure empiricism and pure rationalism, and the birth of a new path—one that honors both sensory experience and the a priori forms of human understanding.
