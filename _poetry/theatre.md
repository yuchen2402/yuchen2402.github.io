Before the curtain lifts,
before anyone speaks,
there is a silence
long enough to forget time.

Then people begin repeating themselves,
saying,
“_It’s cold, isn’t it?_”

Snow begins to fall.
They keep walking
the ones behind pull the ones ahead,
the ones ahead pull the ones behind.

The seats are filled.
Those on stage keep walking;
those below keep watching.

Later, Godot arrives
but where?

In the end, snow fills the theatre.
What are they doing?
Perhaps, still walking.
