title: "Dear Sir,"
excerpt: "She thought she had healed. Until memory returned in the scent of strawberries, the hush of snowfall, the press of an old rose.
In a quiet town and a tender marriage, one woman lives with a past that never left. _Dear Sir,_ is an elegy of memory and longingâ€”a story of love once lost, and how it lingers in the corners of the everyday."
