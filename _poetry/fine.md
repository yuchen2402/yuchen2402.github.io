He sat on the pier,
waiting for someone to ask, _Hey, how are you_?
Then he’d say _fine, I’m good_—
but never _and you_.

Later, when the clock struck twelve,
he and I walked.
Rain was everywhere,
but we said nothing.
Then he slowly crouched to the ground,
pressed his face into the earth,
rain filling his ears, his nose—
but we said nothing.

Later, when the clock struck thirteen,
I was still standing, he still lying there.
I wanted to ask, Hey, how are you?
But we said nothing.

Later, when the clock struck sixteen,
I wanted to know the truth,
so I buried myself in the earth too.

Later,
the clock had no sound,
and we said nothing.
