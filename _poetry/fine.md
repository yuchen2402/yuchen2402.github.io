He sits at the pier,
waiting for someone to ask hey, how are you.
He answers fine, I am good,
never adding and you.

Then the clock strikes twelve.
He walks beside me.
Rain keeps falling at our sides,
and we say nothing.

Then the clock strikes thirteen.
I am still standing.
He is face down on the ground.
I want to ask hey, how are you,
and we say nothing.

Then the clock strikes sixteen.
I want the truth,
so I press myself into the earth.

Then the clock has no sound,
and we still say nothing.
