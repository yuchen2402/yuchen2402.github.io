title: "Dear Sir,"
excerpt: "She thought she had healed. Until memory returned in the scent of strawberries, the hush of snowfall, the press of an old rose.
In a quiet town and a tender marriage, one woman lives with a past that never left. The Letter to Sir is an elegy of memory and longing—a story of love once lost, and how it lingers in the corners of the everyday."

I was delighted to receive your letter and to hear of your well-being.

Your words traveled all the way from the distant East. They were written in spring, yet by the time they reached me, Brighton had already entered winter. Winter in Brighton is beautiful. The waves roll in from the far horizon, carrying with them traces of salt that find their way into my nose. Small waves come ashore with the sea breeze, pushing pebbles up from the seabed onto the sand. The beach, a mix of sand and shingle, breathes out a damp and gentle scent.

As you can imagine, I am sitting now on a stretch of pebble shore, not far from the sea. There is no sign of sand here—only countless pebbles forming the ground beneath my feet. If you were to walk here and occasionally glance down, you might spot a few empty shells that once housed hermit crabs, though no creatures live in them now. I am seated here, and I realize that the sand I could not find lies hidden beneath the pebbles. When I sit down, the moist seawater seeps up from underneath, staining my jeans with dark patches. I did not mean to soil my trousers, nor do I wish to give up this moment of writing to you, and still less do I want to miss the sound of the waves.

So I found, not far from here, a wooden table and chair—unattended and weathered—perhaps once used by customers of an open-air café that has long since been dismantled. The owner must have left this set behind for those who need a place to rest. The surface of the table is uneven, marked with pale spots after years of sea wind. If my handwriting appears untidy, please do not laugh at me. I sincerely hope that this letter, written before the sea, may carry to you the sound of wind and waves. And I hope that when the sunlight sinks behind the ocean, you too will be here beside me.

Sir, it has been more than ten years since our meeting. Throughout these years, there has hardly been a single moment when I have forgotten even the smallest fragment of my memories with you. There are brief instants, perhaps because too much time has passed or because daily life becomes too tangled, when I forget you entirely. But suddenly, when a leaf falls, or when the sunlight flickers across the windowsill, your face returns before my eyes, and your scent circles around me once again. Your shadow lingers in every corner of my life. Every gesture I make seems to echo yours, whether I am aware of it or not. The memory of us continues to shape my existence in ways I cannot resist. And if I were to speak of how uncontrollably I recall you, I would not be stingy with examples—for there are simply too many.

Let me give you just one example, sir—something that happened while I was cooking. It was Thanksgiving, and I was preparing dinner for my husband’s family. I was about to place a marinated turkey, fragrant with herbs and oil, into the oven preheated to a high temperature when I suddenly slipped out of reality and returned to the night of our first dinner together.

The turkey in the roasting pan turned into two rabbits—the very ones we caught separately after you taught me how to hunt. The marinade of oranges, fennel, black pepper, and olive oil that coated the turkey now covered the rabbit instead. It was exactly the same recipe you taught me that evening. Alongside a clear, light wine, we talked for hours.

You told me your hometown was in the East, a place where people once made their fortunes through surgery and now lived in prosperity among beautiful mountains and rivers. You described, with a trace of pride, an elephant-shaped hill near your home, through which boats carrying tourists passed every day. But after this pride came a hint of regret. You said that despite material wealth, the education system there did not encourage the study of fine arts. That was why you had set your own dream—to travel the world, paint the landscapes that moved you, bring them back home, hold an exhibition, and use it as a stepping stone to found a department of oil painting.

To be honest, your words did not strike me deeply at first. But when I saw your paintings, I understood. You had painted the River Thames, shimmering gold under sunlight, as Big Ben struck ten in the morning. You had painted the tulip fields of Keukenhof—from pale pink to bright yellow to deep orange—where the endless sea of blossoms rippled in the breeze, blending softly with distant windmills and tree-lined paths, forming a gentle vision of spring. You had painted Venice in the dim light of late autumn—an evening when mist nearly erased the city’s outlines. Yet the riverside buildings glowed faintly, the orange-gold sunset breaking through the haze from the left, casting warmth over the cool tone of the canvas.

There were many more paintings. Within them I saw traces of Monet and Van Gogh, yet your brushwork was finer, more delicate, forming a style that was wholly your own. Your journey through Europe was nearing its end, and your final stop was a small village near Brighton—where you came to me.

The candlelight flickered. You invited me to dance a waltz. At first I was unsure of myself; though I had danced before, I did not know if the waltz was more complicated. I made a little fool of myself, spilling some wine on the floor. You noticed my dizziness and gently took my hand. By the end of the song, to my surprise, I managed to dance the final steps without once stepping on your knee.

Sir, the memories of you run so deep that they often make me forget where the train of the present is supposed to go. I forgot the turkey; I forgot that my hand was reaching toward the scorching oven. In that brief tangle of memory and reality, my arm touched the hot metal, and a large blister rose instantly on my skin. My husband heard my cry and rushed into the kitchen. The sight of the burn made him frantic. He tore through drawers searching for the burn ointment, dipped a cotton swab into the cream, and applied it carefully so as not to hurt me. Then he wrapped my arm in several layers of gauze. At last, he held my hand gently in both of his, as if the warmth of his touch alone could make the burn heal.

I have never told you, sir, how I came to meet my husband—it was at my mother’s funeral. She passed away the year after you left. My mother had suffered from severe breast cancer. The illness turned her hair white, and after rounds of chemotherapy, it all fell out. My father died in a car accident when I was only three or four, so in my mother’s final years, my brother and I took turns caring for her every day. Neither of us ever complained. Emptying the bedpan, folding her blankets, paying the hospital bills—these were things we felt we ought to do.

When we were children, she worked at a supermarket and still cooked for us after long shifts. On weekends, she took on other odd jobs to make ends meet. Compared with all that she had done for us, the little we did for her at the end seems almost insignificant. She was around sixty when the cancer came. She fought bravely for years, and when she finally let go, we all felt, beneath our tears, a quiet sense of relief for her.

Now my mother has gone to heaven. Though I no longer have a mother, I know she is always watching over me. On the day of the funeral, she lay so peacefully in her coffin, utterly different from how she used to look. She no longer smiled, no longer gazed at us with her usual warmth. My brother and I knew she would never wake again. If we were ever to quarrel over something trivial, she would no longer tremble forward to make peace between us.

Before the funeral began, the pastor greeted us at the church door. He looked at me with such warmth and sincerity. First he said, “May God be with you,” then opened his arms and embraced me. His hands were strong, and I felt his comfort flow from his heart into mine, filling me with warmth.

During the ceremony, he led the guests in singing _Amazing Grace_:

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,

That saved a wretch like me;

I once was lost, but now am found,

Was blind, but now I see.

Through many dangers, toils, and snares,

I have already come;

’Twas grace that brought me safe thus far,

And grace will lead me home.

The melody was so moving that many throats tightened, and tears streamed down many faces. My mother lay so gently in her coffin, as if listening to the pastor and to God’s voice. Her hands were folded around a dewy rose, fresh and beautiful, carefully cut from the garden that morning. It rested quietly upon her heart.

I remembered how she used to trace the sign of the cross upon her chest every day and say grace before each meal. Now the pastor’s singing seemed to give her guidance and peace. I truly saw the faint curve of a smile on her lips. God had taken her hand and led her away, silencing all her pain and all her words.

My father and mother had met and fallen in love in a wheat field. When my father died, my mother stood at the edge of life’s cliff. Only God’s teachings kept her from falling, and from that moment she became a devoted Protestant. She never pressed her faith upon me, yet when I saw her lying in the coffin, then saw that coffin lowered into a small grave and covered with earth, I felt my soul hollow out. Like my mother years ago, I too stood on the edge of a cliff.

I could hear the wind rising through the stone, and seagulls crying before my eyes. When I looked down, there was only darkness—thick, endless darkness. From within it, faces flickered into sight and disappeared again: my mother’s, yours, the pastor’s, my brother’s—one after another, appearing for an instant before being swallowed by the dark.

I must confess, sir. Since the day we parted, I have lived under the constant torment of longing. My soul has been stained with the damp traces of solitude. I have accepted, almost willingly, the way emptiness gnaws at my heart, for I fear that if I ever agree to be healed, you will disappear from my memory altogether.

Carrying that unease and confusion, I tended to my mother day and night until she finally found peace. Standing beneath a black umbrella, I watched the earth cover her coffin. My heart grew more frightened still. Your arrival once made me whole, and your departure took a part of me away. Now my mother’s death has taken another piece, and I have nothing left to anchor my feelings. My spirit drifts like a wandering soul, belonging neither to heaven nor to hell.

A lost lamb needs the guidance of a shepherd, and so I went to the church to pray every day. At first, I simply sat quietly on the back pews. The pastor who had comforted me at my mother’s funeral was there too, offering me patient solace day after day. Through listening to his sermons again and again, I slowly learned to bow my head and pray, asking God to show me the way toward peace.

After each hymn service, I would ask the pastor to sit beside me. With sympathy and gentleness, he listened to my words and answered my questions, day after day. As spring turned to autumn and the seasons circled back again, I continued to go to the church every single day. The light before my eyes grew brighter and clearer; it showed me a path—one without confusion or pain.

The pastor told me many things, and I came to know much about his own life. He had loved his wife deeply, but she died of influenza two winters ago. He had cared for her with perfect devotion, and in her final days, she too passed away as peacefully as my mother did.

For three years, the pastor and I spoke often. We told each other many things and came to know each other’s suffering. We were like two birds on a storm-tossed tree, recognizing one another’s scent and gently tending each other’s wounds. With every conversation, we grew closer, until our lives gradually filled the empty spaces in each other’s hearts. In the end, we could no longer be apart.

I remember one winter evening, after a hymn service. Snow was falling that night, drifting in no particular order. Some flakes landed on my coat and melted instantly into droplets from my body’s warmth. He took my hand, just as he had on the day I first came to church after my mother’s funeral, and led me to the back pew. He helped me into my seat, then sat down beside me on my left. Opening the Bible, he read softly from the Gospel of Matthew, then closed the book with care.

My arm was linked through his. He took my hand, first gently holding my fingers, then entwining them with his own until both our hands rested together upon the red leather cover of the Bible. The calfskin was dyed deep crimson; when tears fell upon it, they left dark marks that soon faded away. It was dusk, and the light of the setting sun streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting the image of Saint Mary holding the infant Jesus across our shoulders.

His hands, like mine, were covered in age spots—thin, bony, lined with fine wrinkles. We sat there with our hands clasped as the church bell struck seventeen times. Then, in a voice that brushed my ear so softly it trembled, the pastor asked, “Will you marry me?” His tone was cautious and tender, as though he were holding a fragile glass vessel in both hands.

I was not surprised, nor did I ever think of refusing. The words “I will” reached his ear as naturally as a sigh.

Our wedding was simple—without ceremony or feast, not even a wedding gown. The pastor could not officiate for himself, so apart from my brother and his parents, there was only one venerable old minister who conducted the service. He borrowed a veil from a newlywed bride and spent nearly half his life’s savings on a small ring. When the winter snow finally stopped, we were married beneath the statue of the crucified Christ.

His temperament was gentle, and his pleasures were simple. On holidays he would host small gatherings for family and neighbors, but on most days he preferred to sit in the single armchair by the window, reading the Holy Scriptures with his reading glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. Occasionally he turned on the television to listen to the news, though the reports he enjoyed most were about fishing and other leisurely things.

I had never paid much attention to his appearance before, but as the days passed, his features became more distinct to me—or perhaps it is better to say that he, my husband, Gilbert, grew clearer in my eyes. His hair was thin, his ears slightly pointed, so that from the front you could almost see both of them in full. He was not tall, about the same height as I, perhaps reaching only to your shoulder. His daily clothing was plain: a clean short-sleeved shirt and denim trousers. In winter we would go to the market together to pick out a reasonably priced but warm down jacket.

Gilbert was truly a master at keeping our life in order. Take, for instance, the time I mentioned before when I burned my arm—he always knew exactly where the first-aid box was kept, even when I could not remember where I had tucked it away. He never grew angry over my small mistakes. Even the time I forgot the keys and locked us both out, he only raised an eyebrow, then burst into laughter. We borrowed the spare key from our neighbor and, as a happy accident, stayed for a delicious roast-beef dinner.

Under his patience, my days settled into quiet rhythm—reading, cleaning, and tending to the small tasks of home. We kept a tabby cat, and when I had nothing else to do, I would comb through her fur to catch the fleas she picked up in the garden. In the kitchen we had a clear division of labor. On ordinary days he planned the meals, but on holidays such as Thanksgiving or New Year’s, the right of decision was mine. I chose whether we would have roast turkey or lamb chops, wine or freshly pressed juice. During those busy gatherings, I became the head chef, and Gilbert was my cheerful assistant.

Our life went on in steady peace. Under his care, I rarely relived the pain of the past, though memories still appeared—my mother’s embrace, and yours—flashing again and again before me, as if time itself refused to let them fade.

Of course, Gilbert knows about my past with you. He knows every trace you left in my life, and he knows how deeply I once suffered because of you. I was never a talkative person; when we were together, it was always you who spoke, and I who listened in silence. After my mother’s death, though, I gradually began to talk more. I would chatter endlessly to those who knew me well, recounting my past—not only about you, but every memory that seemed worth remembering, every moment that had once brought me either joy or pain.

I began to believe that anything which had stirred happiness or sorrow deserved to be remembered, and this belief revealed itself in my inability to stop talking. My need to relive and to speak grew stronger and stronger, until, if I went to sleep without repeating some piece of memory, my temper the next day would always worsen.

Gilbert never tired of listening. His eyes always held that same steady, attentive kindness as I spoke. Every day for an hour or two, we would sit together on the sofa, my head resting on his shoulder, and during those hours he listened to all my memories, learned all my grief. With each confession, I became better at smiling, better at forgetting.

At first, I thought this habit of mine helped only me and could never hurt him. I never meant to wound him. I thought that my stories were just that—stories from the past—and that they would leave no mark upon his heart.

One early morning, I woke earlier than Gilbert. The night before, I had a headache and couldn’t sleep well. Usually, it is he who prepares breakfast for me. He knows so many recipes—fried eggs, waffles, and all kinds of things—and all the cookware in our kitchen is thanks to him. He once told me that he wanted to make me the best breakfasts in the world, to let me taste every kind there was.

That morning, he had planned to make crêpes, but since I was up early, I decided I would make them myself. I got dressed, went into the kitchen, turned on the stove, and began mixing flour, then cracked in two eggs. I added a little baking powder—something I had learned from our elderly neighbor. Funny enough, in this little town everyone seems to be a chef. When we run out of ideas for lunch or dinner, we often knock on our neighbors’ doors to ask for recipes or even to join them for a meal. Of course, we always return the favor by inviting them to dine with us next time.

Soon I heard Gilbert stirring. Every time he gets up, the bed frame creaks and groans—it seems his body is not as nimble as it used to be. I could picture his feet slipping into those gray slippers shaped like small dogs, because I heard them shuffle down the hallway toward the kitchen. His smile appeared at the doorway, and a soft fog from his breath clouded the glass door. Like a child, he drew a heart and a smiling face in the mist, then pointed toward the study, meaning he was going to read there and that I should call him when breakfast was ready.

I laughed and nodded, setting down the whisk to make a heart with my hands in return. He smiled again and went off to the study.

Crêpes are not difficult to make. The method is nearly the same as the one you once showed me for egg pancakes—only I use corn oil instead of peanut oil. I secretly added baking powder because the low-gluten flour had been sitting for some time, and I worried the batter might not rise as softly. I took out the chilled batter from the refrigerator, melted a little butter in the preheated pan, and poured the batter from the center, letting it spread to the edges. After about a minute, I flipped it, and the first crêpe was done.

I made two for Gilbert, topping them with strawberries, blueberries, and chocolate sauce. Then, carrying the plate carefully in both hands, I headed toward the study to call him for breakfast.

At the doorway of the study, I stopped. The wooden door stood ajar. Outside, the early winter snow was drifting down, and the four walls of bookshelves were covered with thin floral cloths—light enough that the titles could still be read under the lamp, yet thick enough to keep the dust away. By the window stood a beechwood desk, a composite piece Gilbert’s father had built for us before our wedding. Its grain was fine, the wax finish carefully polished, and even now it still reflected a soft, gentle light.

On the desk sat a small Baroque-style glass lamp, a little antique Gilbert had bargained for fiercely at the marketplace. He gave it to me as a gift for my fifty-fifth birthday. The glass was richly colored, and the pattern upon it showed Saint Mary cradling the infant Jesus. The main light in the study was off; only that lamp glowed, casting its mellow yellow light across the desk.

In the glow of the lamp lay an open black rectangular box. Its lid was tilted to the side, half-covered in the amber light. Inside was a single rose—a rose that you, Gilbert, and I all knew. It had long since withered. The petals, once bright crimson, had faded to a dark brownish black. They were no longer soft but brittle, showing faint cracks along their edges. The leaves too had dried, yet they still clung to the stem.

That rose had been carefully preserved for years, rarely taken out of its box, though clearly the box itself had been opened often—opened to look, to remember.

In the dim daylight, Gilbert stood hunched before the desk. His white hair stirred faintly in the draft slipping through the window frame. His gaze was lowered, and his loose eyelids drooped so far they nearly covered his eyes, leaving just enough space for his dark pupils to rest upon the rose. His fingers trembled slightly—I could not tell whether it was because of his age or because he had already guessed that I must have handled the rose again the night before.

I often cannot sleep at night. Once or twice a week, I quietly rise from bed and go to the study to look for the rose. On those nights when the pain in my head feels like it might split my skull, your face always appears before me, and I know that the hour of remembering has come again. The rose has always been kept carefully on the second shelf from the top, to the left of the doorway. Gilbert rarely visits that shelf—it holds mostly books on Impressionism and art history, subjects he does not particularly enjoy. That small fact became my excuse: each time I looked at the rose, it felt as though I could return to you, speak with you once more. It was my way of fleeing from the gentle comfort that had begun to smother my sorrow.

Gilbert had not yet noticed me standing behind him. His trembling stopped, and he gently lifted the black lid, placing it back on the box. When he turned around with it in his hands, our eyes met. He saw the plate I was holding, the crêpes still steaming so that a pale mist rose into the air. The scent of strawberries mixed with the sweetness of banana.

Smiling, he asked, “Did you mash banana into the batter?”

I smiled back, tilted the plate slightly, and said, “Yes. I saw some ripe bananas at the market yesterday and thought they’d make the crêpes smell even better.”

Then I stepped out of the study, placed the crêpes on the dining table, arranged the cloth and cutlery neatly, and waited for Gilbert to come out and join me.

Gilbert came out of the study holding a copy of The Shoes of the Fisherman by Morris West—clearly taken from the shelf below the one that held the rose. Every morning at breakfast, he would choose a book to open beside his plate. When our conversation fell into silence, he would lower his head and read a sentence or two. Over the years of this daily ritual, he had read through the entire study—every book at least three or four times.

It was probably time to buy him something new. I thought that in the afternoon, if we had nothing else to do, we could visit the marketplace to look for a few secondhand titles. “Gilbert,” I said, “would you like to get a new book? Let’s go to the market this afternoon and see if there’s anything we can trade for.”

He smiled at me, though his lips were dry and slightly cracked—when he smiled too widely, I could see a faint trace of red. “Alright,” he said, nodding. Reading was his greatest pleasure. Most of his books were on Catholic theology, followed by carpentry manuals. Many of the wooden things in our home—the chairs, tables, bookshelves—had been built by Gilbert and his father together.

His father had been a carpenter, his mother a primary school teacher. She passed away a few years ago from a cerebral hemorrhage. His father never remarried and lived nearby, often joining us for dinner or to watch television. Gilbert resembled him closely. Though a little taller, they both had the same large ears. When they stood side by side, it almost looked as if there were four ears instead of two heads. Their temperaments were alike as well—gentle, patient, and bright. You could see it in their eyes, those shining eyes that seemed to take in everything you said and every subtle expression on your face, storing them quietly in their hearts.

But now, as I looked at Gilbert across the table, I saw something different. His eyes seemed dimmer than before, as if covered by a thin layer of dust. They were fixed on the few remaining crumbs of crêpe on his plate, but I could tell his mind was far away. The rose, though closed back in its box, still lingered in his gaze. It stirred his calm heart, and the tremor it left carried the scent of sadness—so strong that I could almost smell it myself.

I did not know how to break the silence. Gilbert would never scold me, nor would he ask why I had taken the rose out again. He knew its story all too well. I had told him once—too casually, without noticing his face then. I thought Gilbert accepted everything about me. I thought he had long since grown beyond the reach of sorrow.

Sir, I wonder if you still remember. That rose—the one in the box—was the gift you gave me on the day we said goodbye.
